<p>Syllable is a multi-user operating system, right from the ground up.
When you first boot in to your Syllable installation, you'll find that
you have to log in.</p>

<p>Syllable comes with two users pre-installed: root (username "root"
and password "root") and guest (username "guest" and password "guest").
Root is the administrator user, and has complete access to the system.
Guest is a regular user.</p>

<p>To create a new user, log in as root, double-click the Applications
icon on the desktop, double-click the Users folder, and double-click
the Users application.</p>

<center><img src="../files/users.jpg" alt="[Users and Passwords]" align="middle" height="426" width="458"></center><br>

<p>Click the <strong>Add User...</strong> button to create a new user.</p>

<p>Let's say you're creating a user named Spike Spiegel.  Enter the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li> Name: <em>Spike Spiegel</em></li>
<li> Login: <em>sspiegel</em></li>
<li> Home: <em>/home/sspiegel</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Then click the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>

<p>But you're not done yet! The Users application currently doesn't
create the user's directory. You have to do that manually. Open a
Terminal window and type the following:</p>

<div id="terminal">
$ cd /home<br>
$ cp -a guest sspiegel<br>
$ find sspiegel -print | xargs chown sspiegel:users<br>
</div>

<p>This creates Spike Spiegel's home directory, and makes everything in
it owned by that user. Now the user is created, and you can log in as
that user.</p>

Interesting site, it is well written. Registration not so was pleasant,
and with scripts of a problem. Let's vary references, or banners.
