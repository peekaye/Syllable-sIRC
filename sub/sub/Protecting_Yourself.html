<p>As stable and wonderful as Syllable is, it's still possible for bad
things to happen. So, there are some things you can do to prevent those
bad things from causing serious damage when they do happen.
</p>
<p>One neat trick used by at least one Syllable developer is to create
a whole separate partition just for your home directory, and mount it.
That way, if AFS crashes on your system, at least your home directory
will still be okay.
</p>
<p>Oh, and run "sync" from the terminal often.
