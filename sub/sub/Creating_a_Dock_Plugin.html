<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This tutorial explains how to create plugins for the Syllable Dock.
To create a plugin, you must download dockplugin.h from the Syllable
CVS repository (or from ViewCVS), in
syllable/syllable/system/apps/desktop/dock/. This header file is not
included in the default install.</p>

<p>If you examine dockplugin.h, you will see that there is a DockPlugin
class from which all plugins inherit, and a typedef for the
init_dock_plugin() function. This is the function that the dock calls
to initialise the plugin. Creating a plugin is simply a matter creating
a DockPlugin class and a corresponding initialisation function.</p>

<p>A plugin is not an ordinary program, but is a module loaded in by
the dock. This means that the code must be linked with the -shared flag
indicating that a shared library is to be created. Here's an example
from the makefile for Meter:</p>

<pre>g++ -o meter.so -shared meter.o -lsyllable
</pre>

<p>The DockPlugin has three pure virtual methods which must be
implemented by every plugin in addition to the init_dock_plugin()
function. This tutorial will consider each in turn.</p>

<h3>GetIdentifier()</h3>

<p>This method is used by the Dock to uniquely identify each plugin.
This method should return a name and is easy to implement, as seen in
this example from Meter:</p>

<pre>String Meter::GetIdentifier()
{
	return "Meter";
}
</pre>

<h3>GetPreferredSize()</h3>

<p>This method is used by the Dock to determine what size the plugin should be.  The method should return the <em>preferred</em>
size of the plugin; the maximum height and width of the plugin will be
limited to that of the dock. The size that should be returned depends
on the nature of the plugin.</p>

<h3>GetPath()</h3>

<p>This method is used by the Dock to determine the path for the plugin
file. This path is passed to the init_dock_plugin() function, which can
then pass this information to the plugin constructor. Then, in the
plugin constructor, the path can be stored in a member variable ready
to be recalled later. This then makes the implementation of the method
rather easy, as the code from Meter shows:</p>

<pre>Path Meter::GetPath()
{
	return m_cPath;
}
</pre>

<h3>init_dock_plugin()</h3>

<p>Once the Dock has loaded the plugin, it calls this function to
initialise it. The function must create a plugin object and return its
pointer. This is usually done with the <code>new</code> operator. The
path of the plugin and a pointer to the Dock are passed to the
function; normally these are passed straight on to the plugin
constructor. The path is useful for implementing GetPath() as mentioned
above. The dock pointer is of the Looper type. This is useful to have
as it enables the plugin to do things it otherwise could not do, eg set
up timers. The use of the <b>extern "C"</b> construct to allow C linkage is required, as shown in the example below:</p>

<pre>extern "C"
{
	DockPlugin* init_dock_plugin(os::Path cPluginFile, os::Looper* pcDock)
	{
		return new Meter(cPluginFile, pcDock);
	}
}
</pre>

<h3>Finishing off</h3>

<p>This tutorial has only covered the bare bones of creating a dock
plugin. The DockPlugin class is inherited from the standard View class,
thus a plugin is merely a custom View. The rest of the plugin code must
be application-specific and depends on the nature of the plugin.</p>
