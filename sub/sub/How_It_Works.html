<p id="tutorialname">Files</p>
<p>In Syllable, all files are stored in a file system organized much like it is in Unix.

</p>
<p>Your files are stored in a special folder called your <em>home folder</em>.  This is similar to the <em>My Documents</em> folder in Windows.  All your documents and files should go somewhere in your home folder.

</p>
<p>All applications should be installed and available in the /Applications folder.  This is because applications should be available for all users.

</p>
<p><h1>Attributes</h1>
</p>

<p>Syllable files have an extra cool feature: <em>attributes</em>.  An attribute is an extra bit of textual information about a file.  For example, let's say you have a collection of MP3 files; each of those files may have an attribute named "artist" which contains the name of the artist who created the song.

</p>
<p>Attributes are particularly useful because Syllable treats file attributes like a database, so once the appropriate applications are in place, you'll be able to search for files by attribute.  So, you could search for all MP3s with a "genre" of "techno", or all e-mail files with an "author" of "jlg@be.com" and a "date" of at least one month ago.  Handy, no?

</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nobody's written the appropriate applications for searching Syllable files by attribute yet.  But all Syllable files already have attributes, so it's just a matter of some programmer doing it.

</p>
<p><h1>The File System</h1>
</p>

<p>The Syllable file system is called "AFS," and is based on "BFS," the BeOS File System.  You can read more about BFS in the book <a href="http://www.nobius.org/~dbg/practical-file-system-design.pdf">Practical File System Design and the Be Operating System</a> by Dominic Giampaolo.
