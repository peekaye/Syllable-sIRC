<p>OK, today we're going to write a ridiculously simple program, one which will print the sentence <code>Hello, world!</code>
on the screen. It won't teach you the Syllable API, and it won't even
teach you much of C++; it will teach you the basics of how programming
works.</p>

<p>We'll start off by creating a directory to store our developmental
programs in. Open up your home directory in a terminal window, and type
the following:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>mkdir development</b><br>
  $ <b>cd development</b><br>
</div>

<p>OK, it's time to write our first program. Using a text editor,
create a simple plain-text file. No formatting. Add the following to
the file:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;<br>
  return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">A Closer Look At The Program</div>

<p>That's a complete C++ program. Let's go through it line-by-line.
Don't worry if you don't understand everything here; again, the point
of this tutorial is more to get you used to the programming process,
rather than teach you all the particulars of how this particular
program works.</p>

<p>The C++ programming specification actually defines only the very
basic layout of the language. In order to actually do useful things
with C++, you need to add special files called <i>libraries</i> to
your program. A library is just a file which defines special commands.
Thus, the first line of our program uses the special <code>#include</code> command to pull in a particular library file, namely, <code>iostream</code>.   <code>iostream</code> contains commands for <b>i</b>nput and <b>o</b>utput <b>stream</b>s; thus the name of the file.</p>

<p>Then, every program needs a block of code named <code>main</code>.  The program always starts executing here, no matter where the <code>main</code> block is located in the program.  The <code>int</code>
word says that this block will end up with a number value when it's
done processing &#8211; don't worry about exactly why we're bothering with
this right now.</p>

<p>(Actually, the proper term for these blocks is a "function," but we won't worry about that right now either.)</p>

<p>OK, then we use a special command that's part of the <code>iostream</code> library; namely, the <code>cout</code> command.  <code>cout</code> is used to print things on the screen.  We then use the <code>&lt;&lt;</code>
operator (a kind of command), to say that we're not done cout'ing yet,
then we have the special string that we want to print out. This string
must be surrounded with double-quote marks; otherwise, the C++ compiler
won't know where the string begins and ends. Then we put another <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator, and end the <code>cout</code> statement with the <code>endl</code>
operator, which means that this is the end of this line on the screen,
which will move the cursor on the screen to the next line. We end the
line with a <code>;</code>, because all complete lines of code (except those starting with <code>#</code>) must end with a <code>;</code>.</p>

<p>Now, remember how I said that this block will end up with a number
value when it's done processing? Well, we have to say which number
value that is, which is why we finish up this function with <code>return 0;</code>.  We end the program with a <code>}</code>, which finishes up the <code>main</code> function.</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Compiling</div>

<p>All right!  You've written your first program!  Now, save the file as <code>helloworld.cpp</code>, in the <code>development</code> directory of your home directory.</p>

<p>OK, now we get to use the C++ <i>compiler</i>. A compiler is a
program that takes commands in a particular programming language, and
translates them to a whole bunch of commands that the operating system
itself can recognize. Syllable can't directly interpret C++ commands;
you have to compile each C++ program into a Syllable program.</p>

<p>To compile your application, type the following in the terminal window (without the "$"):</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>gcc -lsyllable -lstdc++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld</b><br>
</div>

<p>This will start the <code>gcc</code> program (which is the C++ compiler), telling it to load in the <code>syllable</code> and <code>stdc++</code> compiler libraries, compiling your <code>helloworld.cpp</code> program, and writing out the actual finished program as <code>helloworld</code>.</p>

<p><code>gcc</code> may come back with a bunch of errors. If you get
any errors, go back and make sure that you typed in your code exactly
as it's listed above. If you find any errors, change your code, save
it, and re-type the line above to re-compile your program.</p>

<p>Once you compile without errors, enter the following in the terminal window:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./helloworld</b><br>
  Hello, world!<br>
  $ <br>
</div>

<p>You should immediately get back a line saying <code>Hello, world!</code>.  If so, congratulations!  You've successfully written, compiled, and executed your first Syllable program!</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Variables</div>

<p>It's time to start doing vaguely useful things with C++.  This tutorial will familiarize you with <i>variables</i>.</p>

<p>Variables are simply containers that you can use to store a little
data. You can think of a variable as being like a mug; you can fill it
with water, or you can put a slip of paper into it, or whatever.</p>

<p>However, unlike mugs, variables have to have a particular <i>type</i>.
Whenever you create a variable, you have to say exactly what sort of
thing you want to put into it. Thus, you could create a variable that
will only be able to store one integer number at any given time, or
that will only store text. This would be like declaring that your blue
Hawaii mug is only to be used for drinking out of; nobody should store
pencils in it.</p>

<p>The syntax for creating a variable is simple: First comes the type
of the variable, followed by the name that you want to use for the
variable, followed by a semi-colon ("<code>;</code>").  To put a number in the variable, you just type the name of the variable, followed by an equals sign ("<code>=</code>"), followed by whatever value you want for the variable, followed by a <code>;</code>.</p>

<p>What types are available?  Here's a quick list:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td><b>Type</b></td>
    <td><b>Examples</b></td>
    <td><b>Notes</b></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>int</code></td>
    <td>4, 102</td>
    <td>Integer &#8211; a number with no decimal or fraction part</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>float</code></td>
    <td>3.8, 40.10039, 6</td>
    <td>Floating-point number &#8211; any sort of real number, with or without a decimal place</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>char</code></td>
    <td>'a', '%', '2'</td>
    <td>Character &#8211; a single character</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td>"Hello", "5"</td>
    <td>String &#8211; contains text; must use <code>#include <string></string></code></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>A Quick Example</strong></p>

<p>Let's write an example before we go any farther. We'll write a
simple program that stores a number, then displays it on the screen.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    int num;<br>
    num = 5;<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "The number is " &lt;&lt; num &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }
</div>

<p>OK.  The first thing we did was define a variable, named <code>num</code>, as an <code>int</code>
(integer). We then assign the value of 5 to the variable, and then we
print out a short message which also prints out whatever's in that
variable.</p>

<p>Save this program as <code>variables.cpp</code> in the <code>~/development</code> directory, then open a terminal window and type the following (type everything that comes after a "$"):</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>cd ~/development</b><br>
  $ <b>gcc -lstdc++ variables.cpp -o variables</b><br>
  $ <b>./variables</b><br>
  The number is 5<br>
  $ <br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">Some Simple Math Operations</div>

<p>So, let's review. We've seen how to create variables, and how to
assign a value to them, and how to print that out. Not very exciting.</p>

<p>But wait! We can do math with our variables! We just use that
"variable = value" syntax shown above, and add in mathematical symbols.
Thus, you can do this:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  num = 5 + 9;<br>
</div>

<p>After that command is executed, <code>num</code> will have the value
of 14. This wouldn't be very powerful, except that you can also use
variables in there too. Let's write another example.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include <iostream><br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    <font color="#ff0000">/*  ----- Performs various mathematical operations on 8 and 3.<br><br>
      Perform the math.<br>
      Print out the result.  */</font><br><br>
    float number1;<br>
    float number2;<br>
    float add_result, subtract_result, multiply_result, divide_result;<br>
    number1 = 8;<br>
    number2 = 3;<br><br>
    <font color="#ff0000">/*  Perform the math.  */</font><br>
    add_result     = number1 + number2;<br>
    subtract_result = number1 - number2 - 2;<br>
    multiply_result = number1 * number2;<br>
    divide_result   = number1 / number2;<br><br>
    <font color="#ff0000">/*  Print out the result.  */</font><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; number1 &lt;&lt; " + " &lt;&lt; number2<br>
        &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; add_result &lt;&lt; endl<br>
        &lt;&lt; number1 &lt;&lt; " - " &lt;&lt; number2<br>
        &lt;&lt; " - 2 = " &lt;&lt; subtract_result &lt;&lt; endl<br>
        &lt;&lt; number1 &lt;&lt; " * " &lt;&lt; number2<br>
        &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; multiply_result &lt;&lt; endl<br>
        &lt;&lt; number1 &lt;&lt; " / " &lt;&lt; number2<br>
        &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; divide_result &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</iostream></div>

<p>The first thing you'll notice is a bunch of English sentences, surrounded by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.  These are <i>comments</i>,
which are completely ignored by the compiler. Comments let you make
notes to yourself (and other developers). What I did in the program
above is my standard commenting scheme; I start out with a one-line
description of this function (that is, <code>main</code>), followed by
an outline of what the code does. I then insert each step of the
outline wherever the code itself starts performing that step.
</p><p>You'll also notice a special method of declaring our variables;
rather than listing the type for each one, we listed the type, then a
bunch of variables, separated by commas. This is perfectly legal C++,
and is a convenient, quick way to set up a few variables.
Unfortunately, this particular syntax makes it difficult to read and
find variables, so I don't like to use it often.</p>

<p>We then perform a few mathematical functions, and store the results
in our four result variables. Finally, we print the results out. Note
that we made the <code>cout</code> command work over a number of lines; since the <code>;</code> doesn't appear until after the last <code>endl</code> operator, the C++ compiler will know to treat it all as one <code>cout</code> command.</p>

<p>OK, save the above code as <code>variables1.cpp</code>, and compile it and run it as usual.  Here's what you should see:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  8 + 3 = 11<br>
  8 - 3 - 2 = 3<br>
  8 * 3 = 24<br>
  8 / 3 = 2.666667<br>
</div>

<p>Remember that variables are, well, variable; you can change them at any time during your program.  Thus, this is perfectly OK:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  int var;<br>
  var = 3 + 8;<br>
  cout &lt;&lt; var &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
  var = 100;<br>
  cout &lt;&lt; var &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">String Theory</div>

<p>Before we leave, let's write one final example, one that uses chars and strings, just for completeness.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>
  <font color="#ff0000">#include <string></string></font><br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    string firstName;<br>
    char   middleInitial;<br>
    string lastName;<br>
    string fullName;<br><br>
    firstName = "George";<br>
    middleInitial = 'C';<br>
    lastName = "Scott";<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "The person's name is: ";<br>
    fullName = firstName + " " + middleInitial + ". " + lastName;<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; fullName &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>(By the way, variable names can contain any letters (upper- or
lower-case), numbers, and underscores, as long as they don't start with
a number. Thus, <code>health</code>, <code>a1</code>, and <code>Speaker_System</code> are all valid variable names; <code>2a</code>, <code>health!</code>, and <code>George'C'</code> are not.  Also, variable names are case-sensitive, so <code>health</code> and <code>Health</code> are completely different variables.)</p>

<p>The above should be fairly straightforward; only note that we had to include the <code>string</code>
library, so that we would have string variables. We just stored the
first name, last name, and middle initial of someone into three
variables, then stuffed all of that into <code>fullName</code> (formatted with a few spaces), and printed that out.  Save this program as <code>variables2.cpp</code>, compile it, and run it.  Here's what you should get:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  The person's name is: George C. Scott<br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">Text Input</div>

<p>How many programs do you have that don't need any input from you at
all to do anything useful? Not many, I'll bet. Today we'll look at
reading input from the keyboard, so that we can write some really
useful C++ programs.</p>

<p>Keyboard input is accomplished using <code>cout</code>'s lesser sibling, <code>cin</code>.  <code>cin</code> uses very similar syntax to <code>cout</code>; you simply put in a list of variables that you want to read in.  Let's see an example:</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Number Input</div>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    float number1;<br>
    float number2;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter any number: ";<br>
    <font color="#ff0000">cin &gt;&gt; number1;</font><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter another number: ";<br>
    <font color="#ff0000">cin &gt;&gt; number2;</font><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; number1 &lt;&lt; " + " &lt;&lt; number2 &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; number1 + number2 &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>This program should be fairly obvious. It prompts the user to enter
two numbers, then prints out the sum of the two numbers. Notice how <code>cin</code> works:  You use the command <code>cin</code>, followed by the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator (the reverse of <code>cout</code>'s <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator), followed by the name of the variable that you want to put the user's input into.</p>

<p>Let's run through the program once.  Save the above code as <code>input.cpp</code>, compile it, and run it.  The stuff that you're supposed to type in is in <b>bold</b>:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./input</b><br>
  Enter any number: <b>30</b><br>
  Enter another number: <b>5.5</b><br>
  30 + 5.5 = 35.5<br>
  $ <br>
</div>

<p>Pretty simple, huh?  Let's try this with strings.</p>

<p><strong>String Input</strong></p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>
  #include &lt;string&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    string name;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "What is your name? ";<br>
    cin &gt;&gt; name;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>Save this as <code>input1.cpp</code> and compile it.  Let's run through it once.</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./input1</b><br>
  What is your name? <b>Lain</b><br>
  Hello, Lain.<br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">If Statements</div>

<p>Thus far, our programs have been pretty linear; they start, they do
some stuff, and then they stop. Our programs haven't made any sort of
decision-making. They're about to.</p>

<p>Let's look at the wonderful world of <code>if()</code> statements.  <code>if()</code>
statements are special commands that make a comparison (or a bunch of
comparisons), and make a yes/no decision based on those comparisons.
There are no "maybe's" when you're using <code>if</code>; the result is either true or false.</p>

<p>The syntax of the <code>if()</code> statement looks a lot like the syntax of the <code>main()</code> function.  You start out with <code>if</code>, followed by an opening parentheses ("<code>(</code>"), followed by an <i>expression</i> (more on that in a moment), then a closing parentheses ("<code>)</code>"), an opening curly bracket ("<code>{</code>"), the code that you want to execute if the expression is true, and finally, a closing curly bracket ("<code>}</code>}).  Here's a quick example:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  int i;<br>
  i = 5;<br>
  if( i &gt; 1 )<br>
  {<br>
    i = 1;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>The above declares a variable named <code>i</code>, puts 5 into it, then sees if the value of <code>i</code> is greater than 1.  If <code>i</code> is greater than 1, then <code>i</code> is set to 1.  Simple enough.  Yes, it's silly; we'll see some more useful examples in a little bit.</p>

<p>Note that you can have any number of spaces between the <code>if</code>, the parentheses, and the values of the expression (or no spaces, if you prefer); the following is perfectly legal C++:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  if(i &gt;1)<br>
  {<br>
    i = 1;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>This is OK, too:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  if   (   i &gt; 1   )<br>
  {<br>
    i = 1;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>I just prefer my own little syntax ("<code>if( i &gt; 1 )</code>"); you can format it however you want.</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Expressionism</div>

<p>So, what are these expressions?  An expression is composed of one or more comparisons (e.g., "<code>health &lt; 100</code>", separated by <i>Boolean operators</i>.  Let's see exactly what I mean.</p>

<p>Comparisons are simply a matter of comparing one thing to another;
is the value of this variable greater than this number? Is the value of
this variable equal to the value of this other variable? Here's a quick
list of the operators that you can use:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td><b>Operator</b></td>
    <td><b>Meaning</b></td>
    <td><b>Example</b></td>
    <td><b>Sample value</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><code>&lt;</code></td>
    <td>Less than</td>
    <td><code>if( i &lt; j )</code></td>
    <td><code>1 &lt; 5</code> will be <i>true</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><code>&gt;</code></td>
    <td>Greater than</td>
    <td><code>if( i &gt; j )</code></td>
    <td><code>1 &gt; 5</code> will be <i>false</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><code>&lt;=</code></td>
    <td>Less than or equal to</td>
    <td><code>if( i &lt;= j )</code></td>
    <td><code>1 &lt;= 5</code> will be <i>true</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><code>&gt;=</code></td>
    <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
    <td><code>if( i &gt;= j )</code></td>
    <td><code>1 &gt;= 5</code> will be <i>false</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><code>==</code></td>
    <td>Equal to</td>
    <td><code>if( i == j )</code></td>
    <td><code>1 == 5</code> will be <i>false</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><code>!=</code></td>
    <td>Not equal to</td>
    <td><code>if( i != j )</code></td>
    <td><code>1 != 5</code> will be <i>true</i></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>OK, that makes sense. What about these Boolean operators? Well,
they're a way to put a bunch of comparisons all in one if statement.
For example, what if your program had to check to see if a variable was
within a valid range, say from 1 to 100? You could write it like this:
</p><div id="filetext">
  if( num &gt;= 1 )<br>
  {<br>
    if( num &lt;= 100 )<br>
    {<br>
      /*  Do whatever  */<br>
    }<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>Fortunately, there's an easier way! You can combine conditions
together using Boolean operators. Here are the two main Boolean
operators:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td><b>Operator</b></td>
    <td><b>Meaning</b></td>
    <td><b>Example</b></td>
    <td><b>Sample value</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;&amp;</code></td>
    <td>And</td>
    <td><code>if( a &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; a &lt;= 100 )</code></td>
    <td><code>5 &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; 5 &lt;= 100</code> will be <i>true</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>||</code></td>
    <td>Or</td>
    <td><code>if( a &lt;= 100 || b &lt;= 100 )</code></td>
    <td><code>5 &lt;= 100 || 219 &lt;= 100</code> will be <i>true</i></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>So, we could compress the above code like this:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  if( num &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; num &lt;= 100 )<br>
  {<br>
    /*  Do whatever  */<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">What Else?</div>

<p>OK, what happens if you want to do something when the condition is <i>not</i>
satisfied? For example, let's say we want to protect our program with a
password prompt. If the user enters the correct password, they should
be able to use the rest of the program, but if they don't enter the
right password, they should get an error message.</p>

<p>We can do this with the secret other half of the <code>if()</code> statement; the <code>else</code> clause.  Let's just see it in action:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>
  #include &lt;string&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    string password;<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Login: ";<br>
    cin &gt;&gt; password;<br>
    if( password == "joshua" )<br>
    {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "Greetings, Professor Falken." &lt;&lt; endl<br>
          &lt;&lt; "Shall we play a game?" &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    }<br>
    <font color="#ff0000">else</font><br>
    {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "Access denied." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    }<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>Save and compile this program.  Note that you should <i>not</i> name the program <span id="filename">if.cpp</span>, as the compiled program will be called <span id="filename">if</span>, which is a special command in the Terminal.  It's perfectly fine to call it <span id="filename">if1.cpp</span>.</p>

<p>In any event, let's run the program, giving it the correct password:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./if1</b><br>
  Login: <b>joshua</b><br>
  Greetings, Professor Falken.<br>
  Shall we play a game?<br>
  $ <br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">A Complete Example</div>

<p>Let's write a simple number guessing game. It will ask the player
for a number, which it will then perform a series of calculations on,
to get out of it a number between 1 and 10. The user can then guess
that number.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    /* ----- A number guessing game.<br><br>
      Ask for the seed number.<br>
      Calculate the computer's number from the seed.<br>
      Report on whether the computer's number is more or less than 5.<br>
      Ask for the player's guess.<br>
      Tell the player if s/he won or lost.<br>
    */<br><br>
    int seedNumber;<br>
    int computerNumber;<br>
    int guessedNumber;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Guess a number from 1 to 10!  Impress your friends!" &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl;<br><br>
    /* Ask for the seed number. */<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter any integer number: ";<br>
    cin &gt;&gt; seedNumber;<br>
    /* Calculate the computer's number from the seed. */<br>
    computerNumber = (seedNumber + 97) / 3;<br>
    computerNumber = computerNumber % 10 + 1;<br><br>
    /* Report on whether the computer's number is more or less than 5. */<br>
    if( computerNumber &gt; 5 ) {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "The number I picked is more than five." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    } else {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "The number I picked is no more than five." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    }<br><br>
    /* Ask for the player's guess. */<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Guess the number (it's between 1 and 10): ";<br>
    cin &gt;&gt; guessedNumber;<br><br>
    /* Tell the player if s/he won or lost. */<br>
    if( computerNumber == guessedNumber )<br>
    {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "Congratulations!  You were right!" &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    }<br>
    else<br>
    {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "Sorry!  I had picked the number " &lt;&lt; computerNumber &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    }<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>OK, let's give the game a whirl.  Save the above source code in a file, compile it, and execute it as usual.</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./ifgame</b><br>
  Guess a number from 1 to 10!  Impress your friends!<br><br>
  Enter any integer number: <b>90</b><br>
  The number I picked is no more than five.<br><br>
  Guess the number (it's between 1 and 10): <b>2</b><br>
  Sorry!  I had picked the number 3<br>
  $ <br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">Loops</div>

<p>Today we'll talk about making your program do something over and over again.  Welcome to the wonderful world of loops.</p>

<p>There are two main kinds of loops in C++; <code>while()</code> loops and <code>for()</code> loops.  <code>while()</code> loops are general-purpose loops, whereas <code>for()</code> loops can be seen as a special kind of <code>while()</code> loop that is especially for counting.  You'll see what I mean.</p>

<div id="sectiontext"><i>While</i> You're At It</div>

<p>OK, we have this particular loop called <code>while</code>, which will make your program do the same thing over and over.  The first thing you should worry about is how to <i>stop</i> the loop.  That's easy; you put an expression within the parentheses of the <code>while()</code> loop; say, <code>i == 10</code>.  Once that expression is false, the <code>while()</code> loop will stop.  Let's see an example.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    int counter;<br>
    counter = 1;<br>
    <font color="#ff0000">while( counter &lt;= 3 )</font><br>
    {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "The counter is " &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
      counter = counter + 1;<br>
    }<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "All done." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>Let's take this step-by-step.</p>

<ol>
<li> We create a variable named <code>counter</code>, and set it equal to 1.
</li><li> We start the loop.
  <ol>
  <li> The first thing we do is test the expression in the loop.  <code>counter</code> is less than 3, so we continue into the loop.
  </li><li> We print out a message, containing the value of <code>counter</code>, which will be 1.
  </li><li> We <i>increment</i> <code>counter</code> by 1 (e.g., we take the value of <code>counter</code>, add 1 to it, then put the result back into counter, effectively increasing its value by 1).  <code>counter</code> now equals 2.
  </li><li> We hit the end of the loop, which causes us to go back up to the top.
  </li></ol>
</li><li> Back into the loop again
  <ol>
  <li> First, we re-test the expression.  <code>counter</code> is still less than 3, so we continue through the loop.
  </li><li> We print out a message again; this time announcing that <code>counter</code> is 2.
  </li><li> We increment <code>counter</code> again; this time, <code>counter</code> will equal 3.
  </li><li> We've hit the end of the loop.
  </li></ol>
</li><li> Back to the top of the loop
  <ol>
  <li> Let's re-test the expression.  <code>counter</code> equals 3, which means it is less than or equal to 3, which means we go into the loop once again.
  </li><li> We print out another message, saying that <code>counter</code> is 3.
  </li><li> We increment <code>counter</code>; it now equals 4.
  </li><li> The end of the loop.
  </li></ol>
</li><li> We jump back up to the top of the loop.  This time, <code>counter</code> is greater than 3, so we jump down to after the end of the loop.
</li><li> We print out "<code>All done.</code>"
</li></ol>

<p>Save the above program as <code>while1.cpp</code>, compile it, and execute it.  Here's what you should see:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./while1</b><br>
  The counter is 1<br>
  The counter is 2<br>
  The counter is 3<br>
  All done.<br>
  $ <br>
</div>

<p>A <code>while()</code> loop can have any expression you'd like, including Boolean expressions.  The following is a perfectly valid <code>while()</code> loop expression:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  while( ( i &lt;= 100 &amp;&amp; name == "George" ) || food == 0.5 )<br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext"><i>For</i> He's A Jolly Good Loop</div>

<p>Since a lot of loops are concerned with counting in one way or
another (do this ten times, or go through all of the elements in a
list, or whatever), a special kind of loop was developed, one that is
especially for counting. This new kind of loop is called a <code>for()</code> loop.  It looks like a <code>while()</code> loop, but the expression has three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li> An initialization section, which is used to set the starting value of the counter (e.g., <code>cnt = 1</code>)
</li><li> A condition section, which is used to test when to stop counting (e.g., <code>cnt &lt; 10</code>)
</li><li> A movement section, which is used to change the counter (e.g., <code>cnt = cnt + 1</code>)
</li></ol>

<p>Let's re-write the above example (<span id="filename">while1.cpp</span>) to use a <code>for()</code> loop.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    int counter;<br>
    <font color="#0000ff">for( counter = 1; counter &lt;= 3; counter = counter + 1 )</font><br>
    {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "The counter is " &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    }<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "All done." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>See how much shorter that is than using a <code>while()</code> loop?</p>

<p>Of course, the <code>for()</code> loop has its disadvantages; it's meant for counting.  Complex loops (like one that tests if <code>name == "George"</code>) deserve the <code>while()</code> command.</p>

<div id="sectiontext">A Fun Example</div>

<p>Let's take the number-guessing game from the "If Statements"
tutorial, and expand it using loops. We'll make it so that the game
will continue until the user guesses the correct answer. While (ha!)
we're at it, after every incorrect guess, we'll tell the user if that
guess was too low or too high.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    /* ----- A number guessing game.<br><br>

      <font color="#0000ff">While the user hasn't guessed the correct answer,</font><br>
        Ask for the player's guess.<br>
        Tell the player if s/he was correct.<br>
        <font color="#0000ff">If the player lost, tell if guess was high or low.</font><br>
    */<br><br>
    int seedNumber;<br>
    int computerNumber;<br>
    int guessedNumber;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Guess a number from 1 to 10!  Impress your friends!" &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl;<br><br>
    /* Ask for the seed number. */<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter any integer number: ";<br>
    cin &gt;&gt; seedNumber;<br>
    /* Calculate the computer's number from the seed. */<br>
    computerNumber = (seedNumber + 97) / 3;<br>
    computerNumber = computerNumber % 10 + 1;<br><br>
    /* Report on whether the computer's number is more or less than 5. */<br>
    if( computerNumber &gt; 5 ) {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "The number I picked is more than five." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    } else {<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; "The number I picked is no more than five." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    }<br><br>
    <font color="#0000ff">/* While the user hasn't guessed the correct answer, */<br>
    guessedNumber = 0;<br>
    while( guessedNumber != computerNumber )<br>
    {</font><br>
      /* Ask for the player's guess. */<br>
      cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Guess the number (it's between 1 and 10): ";<br>
      cin &gt;&gt; guessedNumber;<br><br>
      /* Tell the player if s/he was correct. */<br>
      if( computerNumber == guessedNumber )<br>
      {<br>
        cout &lt;&lt; "Congratulations!  You were right!" &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
      }<br>
      else<br>
      {<br>
        <font color="#0000ff">/* If the player lost, tell if guess was high or low. */<br>
        if( guessedNumber &lt; computerNumber ) {<br>
          cout &lt;&lt; "Nope; too low." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
        } else {<br>
          cout &lt;&lt; "Nope; too high." &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
        }</font><br>
      } <font color="#0000ff">/* End if guess was correct */</font><br>
    <font color="#0000ff">} /* end main loop */</font><br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>Now save this as <span id="filename">guess-a-num.cpp</span>, compile it, and execute it.  Here's a sample run:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./guess_a_num</b><br>
  Guess a number from 1 to 10!  Impress your friends!<br><br>
  Enter any integer number: <b>20</b><br>
  The number I picked is more than five.<br><br>
  Guess the number (it's between 1 and 10): <b>7</b><br>
  Nope; too low.<br><br>
  Guess the number (it's between 1 and 10): <b>9</b><br>
  Nope; too low.<br><br>
  Guess the number (it's between 1 and 10): <b>10</b><br>
  Congratulations!  You were right!<br>
  $ <br>
</div>

<div id="sectiontext">Functions</div>

<p>One of the biggest problems in programming today is code
maintenance. The larger your program becomes, the harder it is to track
down errors in the program. Even if a program compiles, that doesn't
mean that it will work properly.</p>

<p>So, today we'll talk about splitting programs up into separate <i>functions</i>.  Functions are just named chunks of code, with a few special properties:</p>

<ul>
<li> Functions can have <i>parameters</i>, which are special variables that are sent to the function when the function is run.
</li><li> Functions can return a value, usually indicating whether the operation performed by the function was successful.
</li></ul>

<p>The good news is that you've been using functions all this time!  You know <code>main()</code>?  That's a function!  Let's look at how we use <code>main()</code>:</p>

<div id="filetext">
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    /* stuff happens */<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>OK, the above code says that <code>main()</code> returns an integer value (<code>int</code>); this is the <i>return type</i> of the function.  The list of parameters is included in the parentheses; in this case, we use the keyword <code>void</code> to say that we don't want any parameters.  We could also use <code>void</code>
for the return type, to say that the function won't return anything. We
then put the contents of the function between a set of <code>{ }</code> brackets.  The last line in the function specifies the integer value that we want to return (<code>0</code>, in this case).</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Parameters</div>

<p>Let's take a closer look at parameters; they are what gives functions most of their power.  But first, we need to talk about <i>local variables</i>.</p>

<p>A local variable is a variable that only exists for part of a
program's execution. Once execution leaves that part of the code, the
local variable ceases to exist; if that piece of code is run later on,
the local variable is re-created.</p>

<p>We can create variables that are local to a particular function.
Thus, whenever that function is run, the variables will be created, and
when the function finishes running, the variables will be cleaned up.</p>

<p>OK, so what are parameters? A parameter is kind of like a special
local variable, one that is given a value by code that asks to run the
function. This lets you send data into a function.</p>

<p>Confused?  Let's see an example.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br>
  <font color="#ff0000">float square( float in )<br>
  {<br>
    return in * in;<br>
  }</font><br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    float num;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter any number: ";<br>
    cin &gt;&gt; num;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; num &lt;&lt; " squared is " &lt;&lt; <font color="#ff0000">square(num)</font> &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>As you can see from this code, we create a function named <code>square()</code>, that has one parameter: <code>in</code>, which is a <code>float</code> (floating-point number).  <code>square()</code> returns the parameter times itself; or the square of the parameter.  The main program asks for a number, then calls the <code>square</code> function, giving it the number that the user entered, and printing out whatever is returned.</p>

<p>When <code>square()</code> is called, its <code>in</code> parameter is given the value of the variable that was used to call the function.  So, if <code>num</code> was 2.3, then when <code>square()</code> was called, <code>in</code> would be given the value 2.3.</p>

<p>Let's run this program, and see what we get.</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./square_it</b><br>
  Enter any number: <b>3</b><br>
  3 squared is 9<br>
  $ <br>
</div>

<p>What about a function with no parameters?  That's easy.  Let's augment the above program to include instructions.</p>

<div id="filetext">
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br><br><br>
  <font color="#0000ff">void print_instructions( void )<br>
  {<br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Square Generator" &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl<br>
          &lt;&lt; "This program displays the square of any number." &lt;&lt; endl<br>
          &lt;&lt; "Enter any number at the prompt (e.g., 4.5), and" &lt;&lt; endl<br>
          &lt;&lt; "the program will print its square." &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
  }</font><br><br><br>
  float square( float in )<br>
  {<br>
    return in * in;<br>
  }<br><br>
  int main( void )<br>
  {<br>
    float num;<br><br>
    <font color="#0000ff">print_instructions();</font><br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter any number: ";<br>
    cin &gt;&gt; num;<br><br>
    cout &lt;&lt; num &lt;&lt; " squared is " &lt;&lt; <font color="#ff0000">square(num)</font> &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
    return 0;<br>
  }<br>
</div>

<p>As you can see, this program now calls the <code>print_instructions()</code> function at the beginning of the program.  <code>print_instructions()</code>
then prints out instructions for using the program. It takes no
parameters, and doesn't return anything. Let's run it and see what we
get:</p>

<div id="terminal">
  $ <b>./square_generator</b><br>
  Square Generator<br><br>
  This program displays the square of any number.<br>
  Enter any number at the prompt (e.g., 4.5), and<br>
  the program will print its square.<br><br>
  Enter any number: <b>5</b><br>
  5 squared is 25<br>
  $ <br>
