<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Syllable is undergoing rapid development, which means that sometimes
things don't work quite as they should. Whether it's unsupported
hardware or a new feature that's causing problems, debugging output can
be captured and sent to the syllable developer mailing list. This will
help the developers improve Syllable and hopefully get your
installation working properly. To do this you will need a second
computer and a null-modem serial cable. If you've got this equipment
then you're ready to start.</p>

<h2>Adding the kernel parameters</h2>

<p>First you will need to enable the debugging output on your Syllable machine. Add the following to the kernel parameters:</p>

<div id="filetext">
debug_enable debug_port=1 debug_baudrate=19200 debug_plaintext=true
</div>

<p>You can do this by editing menu.lst (/boot/boot/grub/menu.lst). The kernel line should now look something like this:

</p><div id="filetext">
kernel /atheos/sys/kernel.so root=/dev/disk/ide/hda/0 debug_enable debug_port=1 debug_baudrate=19200 debug_plaintext=true
</div>

<h2>Setting up the serial terminal</h2>
<p>Now you've setup your Syllable machine to output the debugging
information, you will need to set up the other machine. You will need a
serial terminal program. You can use the following programs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linux - Minicom</li>
<li>Windows - Teraterm</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to setup your terminal to receive at 19200bps (8N1). More details for each terminal program are below.</p>

<h3>Linux - Minicom</h3>

<p>Depending on your distribution the key combination to configure
Minicom will vary. Once the program is running in the bottom left-hand
corner it will say "[key / key combination] Z for help". This special
key or key combination will be called the <b>command key</b> during this tutorial.</p>

<p>Press the command key followed by O to bring up the configuration
menu. Select "Serial port setup". Press A to set the serial port,
normally you should set this to "/dev/ttyS0". Now press E to select the
baud rate and protocol. Set the Speed to "19200", then press Q to set
the protocol.</p>

<p>Now go back out to the configuration menu. Save the configuration.
You may find you need to exit (command key followed by Q) and restart
Minicom for the settings to take effect. Press the command key followed
by L. Type in the name of the file you wish to log the debugging output
to. The machine is now ready to receive the data. Simply boot up your
Syllable machine with the debugging options enabled and hey presto!</p>

<h3>Windows - Teraterm</h3>

<p>At the startup dialog select Serial and COM1. Then go to the "Setup"
menu and select the "Serial Port..." item. Set the baud rate to 19200
and check that data is set to 8 bit, parity to none and stop bit to 1.
Now go to the "File" menu and select the "Log..." item. Select where
you wish the log to be saved and you are ready to go. Simply boot up
your Syllable machine with the debugging options enabled and hey presto!</p>
