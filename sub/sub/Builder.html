<p>To build a binary package from a package that you have built and installed from source:</p>

<div id="terminal">build distro <package-name></package-name></div>

<p>To add support to Builder for a package that it doesn't know how to
build yet, you will have to write a build recipe and possibly add
patches that are needed to make the package work on Syllable. Kaj
hasn't written documentation for that yet, among other reasons because
the exact syntax of build recipes is still being changed and added to.
But he does keep a record of recipe syntax in a file named
skeleton.recipe, which you can find here:</p>

<p><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/syllable/syllable/system/apps/utils/Builder/packages/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/syllable/syllable/system/apps/utils/Builder/packages/</a></p>

<p>You can use skeleton.recipe as an example to pick the options that a
package needs. You should also look at existing recipes for other
packages to see how it's done.</p>

<p>If you are rebuilding parts of the system that depend on eachother
and need guidance, you can consult the build profile for the base
system:</p>

<p><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/syllable/syllable/system/apps/utils/Builder/profiles/base?rev=1.18&amp;view=auto">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/syllable/syllable/system/apps/utils/Builder/profiles/base?rev=1.18&amp;view=auto</a></p>

<p>Builder doesn't handle dependencies yet, but the modules list in the
profile is roughly ordered in the order of dependencies. A crude way to
rebuild Syllable would be to do:</p>

<div id="terminal">
cd system<br>
build base
</div>

<p>See what breaks and install modules that succeeded but are needed by later modules:</p>

<div id="terminal">build install <path-to-module></path-to-module></div>

<p>Be aware that there may still be bugs in the install targets of makefiles. Then do:</p>

<div id="terminal">build failures</div>

<p>And repeat the process until everything works.</p>
