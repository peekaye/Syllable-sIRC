<h3>Writing translatable software</h3>

<p>This article will show you how to write native Syllable applications
that are translatable. It will also explain how the translations are
dealt with by the operating system.</p>

<h3>Catalogues and Strings</h3>

<p>In order to make your programme translatable, you have to separate
the text strings from your code. You do this by creating a catalogue
file, that contains labels for your strings as well as the strings
themselves.
The catalogue file itself is in a binary format, but there is also a
human readable representation, a kind of source file, that I will use
to illustrate the catalogue:</p>

<div id="filetext">
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE=100	File<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_OPEN	_Open<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_SAVE	_Save<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_EXIT	E_xit<br>
</div>

<p>This file can be compiled to binary format using CatComp (available
from Syllable CVS). Please note that it is also possible to create,
edit and translate binary catalogues, using CatFish.</p>

<p>As you see in the code listing above, this particular catalogue
contains four strings, identified by four labels. The first line
contains a number as well. This number tells the catalogue compiler
that the first string should have ID 100. The second string will be
101, the third 102, and so on. The numbers are used by the compiled
code to indentify the strings inside the catalogue file, but in your
code you'll refer to the strings by their labels. You can leave the
numbering entirely up to CatComp if you want to, but there are some
issues with
numbering that CatComp cannot handle itself. We'll return to this topic
later on.</p>

<p>The catalogue file is normally named "<application>.catalog", where <application>
is the name of your application. The catalogue files can be stored
either in the application directory or inside the application
executable.</application></application></p>

<h3>Localised Resources</h3>

<p>So, how will my programme find the catalogues?</p>
<p>There are currently two ways in which resources (ie. files) can be
stored, in such a way that they can be selectively retrieved based on
the user's preferred language(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded in the executable.
</li><li>In the application's directory, in a sub directory named "resources".
</li></ul>
<p>Both of these methods rely on a directory hierarchy to convey the
language information. For instance, the application HelloWorld might
have been translated to Hungarian, English, Finnish and Czech. One of
these languages would have to be the "default" language, that is, a
language that is assumed unless the user chooses another. In this case,
we'll choose English. Now we wind up with the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>HelloWorld.catalog - English.
</li><li>cs/HelloWorld.catalog - Czech.
</li><li>fi/HelloWorld.catalog - Finnish.
</li><li>hu/HelloWorld.catalog - Hungarian.
</li></ul>
<p>The programmer may now choose to embed these files into the
executable. She or he may also chose to store some of the files in the
"resources" directory, but in any event, the default catalogue should
be embedded, or you may be unable to even produce sensible error
messages if the user has lost some files. Now, for the sake of this
example, let's say that this programmer embeds all of the files and
releases the application as a single executable file.</p>
<p>Now, somebody in Germany finds this file, says "Warum gibt es keine
deutsche Übersetzung?", which is German for "What day comes after
thursday?". Ok, just kidding. ;-) Anyway, he wants to translate this
essential piece of software to his language. What he would do then, is
that he would extract one of the catalogues from the executable and
load it into CatFish. Then it's just a matter of translating the
strings, and saving the file. Now he has the choice of embedding the
German file, or storing it in the above mentioned directory. He's a
lazy guy, so he chooses the latter:</p>
<ul>
<li>resources/de/HelloWorld.catalog - German.
</li></ul>
<p>And voilà, now it speaks German! He can now send the translation back to the programmer, or distribute the file himself.</p>
<p>Other resources, such as pictures that contain words or certain
symbols and sounds that contain speech, can be treated in a similar
fashion. Remember that all symbols aren't international. For instance,
on the BBC quiz "The Weakest Link", a red checkmark means "correct" and
a green cross means "wrong". That's the opposite of what those
symbols mean to a Swede, whose culture and language isn't all that
different from a Briton's.</p>

<h3>Hello World!</h3>

<p>Let's have a look at the international Hello World programme.</p>

<p><b>Step 1.</b> Create a directory named "resources" where you keep the source code
to your application.</p>

<p><b>Step 2.</b> Create a text file in that directory, named HelloWorld.cd. This file
should contain "mnemonics" and default strings. Example:</p>

<div id="filetext">
MSG_HELLO_WORLD		Hello World!<br>
MSG_HELLO_AGAIN		Hello Again!
</div>

<p><b>Step 3.</b> Run "catcomp -c HelloWorld.cd". This will create two new files,
HelloWorld.h and HelloWorld.catalog.</p>

<p><b>Step 4.</b> Add these includes to your code:</p>

<div id="filetext">
#include &lt;util/catalog.h&gt;
#include "resources/HelloWorld.h"
</div>

<p>And this should go in your Application constructor (eg. MyApp::MyApp()),
before you create windows or anything that may require anything from a
catalog:</p>

<div id="filetext">
SetCatalog( "HelloWorld.catalog" );
</div>

<p><b>Step 5.</b> Use the MSG_* mnemonics where you would normally type in a text
string, eg:</p>

<div id="filetext">
m_pcHello = new Button( Rect(), "m_pcHello", MSG_HELLO_WORLD, ... );
</div>

<p><b>Step 6.</b> Add HelloWorld.catalog as a resource to your application executable:</p>

<div id="filetext">
rescopy -r HelloWorld resources/HelloWorld.catalog
</div>

<h3>Translating the application - Ahoj Sv&#283;t!</h3>

<p>This section shows how to translate an application to Swedish using the original
HelloWorld.cd file, and the catcomp tool. Please note that you can also use the GUI
tool CatFish to translate any program without access to the .cd file.</p>

<p><b>Step 1.</b> Create a directory named "sv" in the resources
directory. The name is the two-letter ISO code for the language. If
there is no two-letter for your language, use the three-letter code.</p>

<p><b>Step 2.</b> Copy the HelloWorld.cd file to the new directory./p&gt;

</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Translate the words in the copied HelloWorld.cd file:</p>

<div id="filetext">
MSG_HELLO_WORLD		Hej Världen!<br>
MSG_HELLO_AGAIN		Hej Igen!<br>
</div>

<p><b>Step 4.</b> Compile the catalog:</p>

<div id="terminal">
catcomp -t HelloWorld.cd
</div>

<p><b>Step 5.</b> Add the compiled catalog file as a resource, including the path
component "sv":</p>

<div id="terminal">
rescopy -r HelloWorld resources/sv/HelloWorld.catalog=sv/HelloWorld.catalog
</div>

<h3>Hello World 2.0 - Adding new strings</h3>

<p>Now it's time to release the new and upgraded Hello World. The
release needs a new string. Let's see what issues are involved with
this, and how the localisation system will deal with them.</p>
<p>When you add a new string to you application, you will of course
have to get all the translators to translate it. This will take a lot
of time, and it may never be translated to all languages. If it's a
small change, the programme may be useful to international users, even
if not all strings are translated. Thus, you may want to use an old
catalogue with a new programme. In order to make this possible, there's
one important thing to keep in mind:</p>
<box>When adding a string, you must ensure that the old string ID's aren't changed.</box>
<p>This simply means that you add new strings to the end of the file.
However, in big applications, you may want to keep a logical structure
in the catalogue file. In that case, you'll want to take control over
the assignment of ID's. Let's say you have a catalogue like this one:</p>
<div id="filetext">
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE=100	File<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_OPEN	_Open<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_SAVE	_Save<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_EXIT	E_xit<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_EDIT=200	Edit<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_EDIT_CUT	C_ut<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_COPY	_Copy<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_PASTE	_Pase
</div>
<p>Notice the "=200" ID assignment for MSG_MAINWND_MENU_EDIT.</p>
<p>Now you can add a new item to the "File" menu:</p>
<div id="filetext">
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE=100	File<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_OPEN	_Open<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_SAVE	_Save<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_EXIT	E_xit<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_PRINT	_Print<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_EDIT=200	Edit<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_EDIT_CUT	C_ut<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_COPY	_Copy<br>
MSG_MAINWND_MENU_FILE_PASTE	_Pase
</div>
<p>The string Print will now have a unique ID (in this case, 104). Edit stays at ID 200.

</p><h3>The importance of labels</h3>

<p>So, why all these horribly long string labels?! Why not just write</p>
<div id="filetext">
FILE=100	File<br>
OPEN	_Open<br>
SAVE	_Save<br>
EXIT	E_xit<br>
PRINT	_Print<br>
...
</div>
<p>The string itself ("File", "Open", and so on) is often not enough
for a translator to be able to make a 100 per cent correct translation.
Just think about the word "Open". It can mean many things. The
translator needs to know the context.</p>
<box>Choose string labels that:
</box><ul>
<li>Describe the context of the word. If it's in a menu named "File" in the main window, make sure the label says that.</li>
<li>Are synonymic, if possible. E.g. if the text says "Open", use LOAD in the label.</li>
</ul>
