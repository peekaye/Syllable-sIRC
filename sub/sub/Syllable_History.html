<p>The Syllable project dates back to July 2002, but the story begins well before that.

</p>
<p>The history of Syllable really begins with an operating system named
BeOS, which was developed throughout the 1990's by a small company
named Be made up primarily of former Apple employees who were
dissatisfied with the direction of Apple. They developed BeOS as a
modern, powerful speed demon of an operating system that was
particularly suited for heavy multimedia applications (you should have
seen a BeOS machine running thirty simultaneous videos, smooth as
butter).
</p>
<p>Though Be was eventually bought out by Palm and BeOS was liquidated,
it inspired a young programmer named Kurt Skauen in his efforts to
create a hobby operating system. In the late 90's and early 00's, he
created AtheOS, borrowing heavily from BeOS' file system and
programming API.
</p>
<p>After a few years, Kurt abandoned AtheOS to pursue other dreams. In
July 2002, a team of devoted AtheOS enthusiasts forked AtheOS and made
Syllable.
</p>
<p>Since then, the Syllable development team has been working to polish
Kurt's work and turn it into a general-purpose operating system that
anyone can use.

<hr>Huh? From what I remember, Kurt began AtheOS before the BeBox was
shipped in 1995. He was inspired to create an AmigaOS clone after
Commodore went down... as he was an Amigan. He probably didn't even
know BeOS existed at that stage.
<hr>Yes, this is all rather mysterious. AtheOS was largely rewritten
several times, and the above story pertains to the last version, that
became Syllable. I would like to know more dates, too.

<hr>Hmm I remember reading somewhere that AtheOS was started 3 months
after Commodore went broke. That'd date AtheOS to July/August 1994. I
guess the only person who'd know for sure is Kurt himself.

<hr>
From http://www.atheos.cx/: (Kurt's words?) "I started working on AtheOS before the first BeBox was shipped."

That was either Jan or Aug 1996 according to http://www.bebox.nu/history.php

And I too never heard that AtheOS had anything to do with BeOS.  Indeed, I thought it was *loosely* Amiga-inspired.

<hr>
It reminds me somewhat of BeOS, but it definitely has a destinct fragrance of Amiga.

<hr>The timeline of Syllable begins with AtheOS:
early 1990s: Kurt Skauen is inspired by the Amiga to create his own
hobby OS.
1994: as Commodore goes broke, Kurt becomes an Amigan - he learns about
the inner workings of the Amiga, juggling study time at school while
learning the intricacies of his favorite computer system.
early 1996: Kurt creates AtheOS almost from scratch. August 1996: BeBox
introduced to the world. It borrows alot from Amiga and UNIX.
1997-2002: AtheOS gains fans who forked it as Syllable.
2002: A revised history of Syllable is created, which ties Syllable to
BeOS by creating the mythology that AtheOS was influenced by BeOS.
Actually, Kurt's early experience with Amiga inspired him to create
AtheOS from scratch.
Today, Syllable carries on the legacy of AtheOS with the invigorating
aroma of BeOS, and the subtle flavor of Amiga.
