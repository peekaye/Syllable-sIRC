<p>Syllable has a neat feature called <em>workspaces</em>, which you can think of as twelve different desktops, all working at the same time.

</p>
<p>You're already using workspaces! When you log in to Syllable, you're
automatically placed in workspace 1, and eleven other workspaces are
ready for your use.
</p>
<p>To access each workspace, press and hold the <strong>Alt</strong> key, then press one of the function keys at the top of your keyboard.  To go to workspace two, press and hold <strong>Alt</strong>, then press <strong>F2</strong>.  For workspace ten, press <strong>Alt F10</strong>.  To return to workspace one, press <strong>Alt F1</strong>.

</p>
<p>How are workspaces useful? Imagine having your web browser open on
workspace 1, and a word processor open on workspace 2. While you're
writing your novel on workspace 2, you can immediately switch to your
web browser with a quick press of <strong>Alt F1</strong>.

how is an application shunted from one workspace to another? I did it by accident once, so I'm wondering how to do it again.
