<p></p><h3>Does Syllable run in VMware version x?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Syllable (as of 0.5.1) runs in VMware 3.2 and 4.0 for Linux, and
VMware 3.0 for Windows. This makes it more likely that it also runs in
3.2 and 4.0 for Windows and 3.0 for Linux. AtheOS (which Syllable is
based on) runs in VMware 2.x, so it is likely Syllable also runs in
VMware 2.x. If you have information about Sylable running or not
running in specific VMware versions, please mail <a href="mailto:dang@fprintf.net">Daniel</a>

</p>
<p></p><h3>Where can I get a VMware image with Syllable already installed?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There is a base install Syllable image pre-installed in a VMware 3.2 image available at <a href="http://www.fprintf.net/atheos/atheosvm.html">fprintf.net</a>.  In addition, there is a Syllable image with developer tools in VMware 4 at <a href="http://syllable.halebob.org/">syllable.halebob.org</a>.  The syllable.halebob.org image is newer than the one at fprintf.net.

</p>
<p></p><h3>Why is my screen messed up in Syllable?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>VMware 3.2 (and possibly other versions) seem to have problems with
the Syllable VESA driver. The only resolution known to work in all
situations is 1024x768 with 32 bits per pixel. Some other resolutions
are reported to work with some video card/driver combinations of the
host OS.
</p>
<p></p><h3>Why won't Syllable boot in VMware? The boot disk does.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>VMware assumes that its Guest OSs do not use memory beyond a certain
address (0xf7ffffff). Ordinarily, Syllable does use this region, which
causes it to not boot in VMware. There is a kernel parameter (which the
boot disks already have) work-around for this. The parameter is
"uspace_end=0xf7ffffff", which needs to be on the end of the kernel
line in "/afs/boot/grub/menu.lst".
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might need to disable DMA.  To do this, at the GRUB prompt, hit <strong>E</strong>, then move down to the line that starts:

</p>
<pre>kernel=
</pre>

<p>Hit <strong>E</strong> again to edit that line and add:

</p>
<pre>enable_ata_dma=false
</pre>

<p>Press <strong>Enter</strong>, then <strong>B</strong> to boot with the modified configuration.

</p>
<p></p><h3>Why is everything so slow?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Recent versions of Syllable have a real ATA driver for hard drives.
This driver does not work well with VMware, and runs extremely slowly.
The solution is to use the BIOS driver, rather than the ATA driver.
Change your GRUB boot menu to something like this (changing partition
information to match your install):
</p>
<pre>kernel /atheos/sys/kernel.so root=/dev/disk/bios/hda/0 hda=bios ata0=disable ata1=nodma uspace_end=0xf7ffffff
module=/atheos/sys/drivers/fs/afs
module=/atheos/sys/drivers/dev/disk/bios
</pre>

<p>Note that this will still allow the CD to work, as long as it's a
secondary master (which is the default for VMware). The kernel line
should be one line.
</p>
<p>Another approach (tested under VMWare 4.5.2 and Syllable 0.5.4) is to use the ATA driver with this kernel line:

</p>
<pre>&lt;filename&gt;kernel /atheos/sys/kernel.so root=/dev/disk/ata/hda/0 uspace_end=0xf7ffffff enable_ata_dma=false&lt;/filename&gt;
</pre>

<p></p><h3>Does Syllable support the AMD PCNET network card in VMware?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Theoretically, yes. There is a driver for this card included with
Syllable. There are reports that it does not work with VMware 3.2 for
Linux. There are reports that it does work on VMware 3.x for Windows.
YMMV.
</p>
<p></p><h3>What about NAT?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are reports that Syllable 0.5.1 that has an Ethernet connection using NAT works in VMware.

<hr>
the net driver works in vmware 4.0 for syllable 0.5.1
<hr>If your install hangs because of DMA issues, try to simply add
"enable_ata_dma=false" at the end of the kernel line in Grub (use the
'e'dit option). Worked for me, VMWare 4.5.0, Syllable 0.5.4. -jd

<hr>Works on VMWare workstation 5 beta. After installation, Grub hangs
("GRUB _"). Solution: when you set up the partition, start at sector 63
(seems like the sectors 0-62 are needed by Grub?)

Network works in VMWare Player if you use NAT and enable dhcp in Syllable.
