<p></p><h2>Changing a Program's Icon</h2>
<p></p>

<p>To change a program's icon, you'll need to use the command-line tool "rescopy".

</p>
<p>A program can have up to two PNG icons associated with it, one 24x24
pixels in size, and the other 48x48 pixels. These icons are stored as
resources within the program's executable file.
</p>
<p>To change a program's icon, you first need to know if there are
icons already associated with it. Type the following in a terminal
window:
</p>
<pre>rescopy -l &lt;application&gt;
</pre>

<p>A list of all resources associated with the file is displayed. If
there are no entries for "icon24x24.png" or "icon48x48.png" in the
listing, the program has no icons associated with it, so you'll need to
add your icons.
</p>
<p></p><h3>Adding an icon</h3>
<p></p>

<p>To add an icon to a program, name the icon "icon24x24.png" if it's a
24x24 pixel icon, or "icon48x48.png" if it's a 48x48 pixel icon. To add
a 24x24 pixel icon, enter the following in the terminal:
</p>
<pre>rescopy -a &lt;application&gt; icon24x24.png
</pre>

<p>For a 48x48 pixel icon, enter the following:

</p>
<pre>rescopy -a &lt;application&gt; icon48x48.png
</pre>

<p>You're done!

</p>
<p></p><h3>Replacing an icon</h3>
<p></p>

<p>If the program already has associated "icon24x24.png" or
"icon48x48.png" resourcess, you'll need to replace them by typing the
following in a terminal window (assuming a 24x24 pixel icon):
</p>
<pre>rescopy -r &lt;application&gt; icon24x24.png icon24x24.png
</pre>

<p>This instructs rescopy to replace the "icon24x24.png" resource with
the "icon24x24.png" file you created. Replace "24x24" with "48x48" in
the above example to replace the 48x48 pixel icon.
</p>
<p>That's it!

</p>
<p></p><h3>More Information</h3>
<p></p>

<p>Syllable uses the Bluecurve icons for many of its icons.  You can <a href="http://msa.section.me.uk/syllable/bluecurve-icons.tar.gz">download the Bluecurve icons</a> for free; anybody can use them in any application.

</p>
<p>For more information on rescopy, type the following in a terminal window:

</p>
<pre>rescopy --help
</pre>

<p>NOTE: If rescopy quits with the error 'sh: objectcopy not found', install the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/syllable/DevelopersDelight.bin.4.tgz?download">Developer's Delight package</a>
