<p></p>
<p>This preferences window lets you change the decor of Syllable to suit your own tastes.  There are seven decors available:

</p>
<ul>
<li> Beish</li>
<li> Drow</li>
<li> Mulvane</li>
<li> Photon</li>
<li> Red</li>
<li> Win98</li>
<li> amiga</li>
<p></p></ul>

<p></p>
<p>To change the decor, click the <strong>Decor</strong> drop-down, select a Decor, and click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.

</p>
<p>You can also change the Themes within each Decor. Each Theme
specifies a number of colors for each element of the Syllable user
interface. The following elements are available:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Application &#8211; The background color for each application window</li>
<li> Highlight</li>
<li> Shadow</li>
<li> Active Window</li>
<li> Window Border</li>
<li> Menu Text</li>
<li> Menu Highlight Text</li>
<li> Menu Background</li>
<li> Menu Highlight</li>
<li> Scrollbar Background</li>
<li> Scrollbar Knob</li>
<li> Listview Tab</li>
<li> Listview Tab Text</li>
<p></p></ul>

<p></p>
<p>To change the theme, select an element from the drop-down list, move the <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>Green</strong>, or <strong>Blue</strong> sliders or change the text fields, and click the <strong>Save Scheme</strong> button.

</p>
<p>To delete a theme, select it in the <strong>Theme</strong> drop-down list and click the <strong>Delete Theme</strong> button.</p>
<p id="tutorialname">Font Preferences</p>

<p></p><center><img src="../files/font_prefs.png" alt="[IMAGE]"></center>

<p></p>
<p>The Font Preferences window lets you choose the fonts used throughout Syllable.  Syllable uses fonts in five different ways:

</p>
<ul>
<li> Normal &#8211; The default font</li>
<li> Bold &#8211; A bold version of the normal font</li>
<li> Fixed &#8211; Used when displaying code or other text that requires a fixed-width font</li>
<li> Window &#8211; Used for window titles</li>
<li> Tool Window</li>
<p></p></ul>

<p></p>
<p>To change a font, click the appropriate drop-down menu, then click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.  To change a font's size, type the new font size in the font size field next to the appropriate font, then click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.

</p>
<p>By default, Syllable <em>anti-aliases</em> text, which smooths out the jagged edges of text.  Anti-aliasing looks odd on some monitors.

</p>
<p>To change Syllable's anti-aliasing policy, click the <strong>Anti-Aliasing</strong> checkbox underneath the Tool Window field and click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.

<p id="tutorialname">Keyboard Preferences</p>

<p></p><center><img src="../files/keyboard_prefs.png" alt="[IMAGE]"></center>

<p></p>
<p>The keyboard preferences window lets you change the keyboard layout and certain keyboard options.

</p>
<p>The Initial Delay is the amount of time that Syllable will wait
after a key is first pressed to begin repeating the key. If this is set
to a long period of time, Syllable will wait a long time before
repeating the key.
</p>
<p>The Repeat Delay is the amount of time that Syllable will wait to repeat a key once the key has begun repeating.

</p>
<p>The following keyboard layouts are currently suppled with Syllable:

</p>
<ul>
<li> American</li>
<li> Belarusian</li>
<li> Belgian</li>
<li> British</li>
<li> Danish</li>
<li> Dvorak</li>
<li> Faeroese</li>
<li> French</li>
<li> German</li>
<li> Hungarian</li>
<li> Italian</li>
<li> Norwegian</li>
<li> Polish</li>
<li> Russian</li>
<li> Spanish</li>
<li> Swedish</li>
<li> Turkish_F</li>
<li> Turkish_Q</li>
<li> Ukrainian</li>
<p></p></ul>
To change the keyboard layout, select a new layout from the <strong>Keyboard Layout</strong> list, then click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.

<p></p>
<p>To test your new keyboard preferences, click the <strong>Apply</strong> button and type in the <strong>Test Area</strong> field. Some characters won't display in the Test Area field owing to whichever font it is using.</p>
<p id="tutorialname">Media Preferences</p>

<p></p><center><img src="../files/media_prefs.png" alt="[IMAGE]"></center>

<p></p>
<p>The Media Preferences window lets you change your preferences for a wide variety of media that is available in Syllable.

</p>
<p>First, select the media that you want to affect in the list on the left-hand side of the window.

</p>
<p>If the media has volume controls, you'll see two sliders for each control, as well as a <strong>Lock</strong> checkbox.  If the <strong>Lock</strong> checkbox is checked, each slider will be set to whatever value the other slider is set to.  If the <strong>Lock</strong> checkbox is unchecked, you can set each slider to different values.

</p>
<p>If a media is set as a default output (for audio or video), a green checkbox will be displayed next to that media in the list.

</p>
<p>To set a media as the default output for audio or video, select it in the list, then click the <strong>Default video output</strong> or <strong>Default audio output</strong> checkboxes.

</p>
<p>The <strong>Video Overlay Output</strong> option won't work with some video cards, so select <strong>Video Bitmap Output</strong> if this is the case (Video Overlay Output will perform better, so use it when possible). Use <strong>Direct OSS</strong> if the <strong>Media Server</strong> option is is unreliable for you.

</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Controls...</strong> button should display a window of general media controls.

</p>


<p></p>
<p id="tutorialname">Screen Preferences</p>

<p></p><center><img src="../files/screen_prefs.png" alt="[IMAGE]"></center>

<p></p>
<p>The Screen Preferences window lets you control the resolution,
colour depth, and refresh rate of this workspace or any workspace.
</p>
<p>(Syllable maintains twelve <em>workspaces</em>, which you can think
of as different work areas. If you launch a window in one workspace,
you can switch to another workspace and it will be clear of the window
in the first workspace. Multiple workspaces let you organize windows
into different areas. To switch to workspace 2, press <strong>Alt F2</strong>; to switch to workspace 3, press <strong>Alt F3</strong>, and so forth.)

</p>
<p>NOTE: You must be logged in as root to change screen preferences.

</p>
<p>The <strong>Resolution</strong> controls how many pixels Syllable
will display on the screen. A higher resolution will fit more on the
screen, but everything on the screen will be smaller. Also, some older
video cards and monitors do not support higher resolutions. You can
choose from the following resolutions: 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768,
1152x864, or 1280x1024.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Colour Depth</strong> controls the number of colors
Syllable will use for each pixel. A higher colour depth will give you
richer colors, but might slow down your computer somewhat. You can
choose from the following colour depths: 15 Bit, 16 Bit, or 32 Bit. 16
Bit is generally the best option.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Refresh Rate</strong> controls how many times per second
Syllable refreshes the display. A higher refresh rate is usually easier
on the eyes, but some older video cards and monitors do not support
higher refresh rates. A high refresh rate could permanently damage your
video card! You can choose from the following refresh rates: 60 Hz, 75
Hz, or 100 Hz. Leave it on 60Hz if you've got an LCD.
</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Apply to</strong> drop-down menu to select whether to apply your changes to <em>This workspace</em> or <em>All workspaces</em>.

</p>
<p>When trying a setting for the first time, go to a new workspace (press <strong>ALT F12</strong> for example) and use the <em>This workspace</em>
option. This way, if you choose a setting that corrupts the screen or
locks the computer up, you can recover the system from it. Be careful
of using 32 Bit colour depth with the Matrox driver at this time, as it
may cause lock ups.
</p>
<p>To make changes, change any of the fields, then click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.  To reset all fields to what they were when you first opened the Screen Preferences windnow, click the <strong>Undo</strong> button.  To reset the fields to their default values of resolution <em>640x480</em>, colour depth <em>15 Bit</em>, and refresh rate <em>60 Hz</em>, click the <strong>Default</strong> button.

</p>

<hr>We should probably add a confirm-dialogue so Syllable switches back
within 10 seconds (or something like that) if the change isn't
confirmed. That would be immensely useful when you choose a refresh
rate the monitor cannot handle.

<p id="tutorialname">Changing the Background</p>

<p>If you want to use your own image as your desktop background, copy
the image to the Pictures folder in the Documents folder in your Home
folder. Double-click the <strong>Preferences</strong> icon on the desktop, then double-click the <strong>Desktop</strong> icon in the <strong>Preferences window</strong>.  Select the image you want to use as your background, and click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.  The image you selected appears as the background image.

</p>
<p>Images can be in JPEG, GIF, or PNG format.</p>
<p id="tutorialname">Changing a Programs Icon</p>
<p></p><h2>Changing a Program's Icon</h2>
<p></p>

<p>To change a program's icon, you'll need to use the command-line tool "rescopy".

</p>
<p>A program can have up to two PNG icons associated with it, one 24x24
pixels in size, and the other 48x48 pixels. These icons are stored as
resources within the program's executable file.
</p>
<p>To change a program's icon, you first need to know if there are
icons already associated with it. Type the following in a terminal
window:
</p>
<pre>rescopy -l &lt;application&gt;
</pre>

<p>A list of all resources associated with the file is displayed. If
there are no entries for "icon24x24.png" or "icon48x48.png" in the
listing, the program has no icons associated with it, so you'll need to
add your icons.
</p>
<p></p><h3>Adding an icon</h3>
<p></p>

<p>To add an icon to a program, name the icon "icon24x24.png" if it's a
24x24 pixel icon, or "icon48x48.png" if it's a 48x48 pixel icon. To add
a 24x24 pixel icon, enter the following in the terminal:
</p>
<pre>rescopy -a &lt;application&gt; icon24x24.png
</pre>

<p>For a 48x48 pixel icon, enter the following:

</p>
<pre>rescopy -a &lt;application&gt; icon48x48.png
</pre>

<p>You're done!

</p>
<p></p><h3>Replacing an icon</h3>
<p></p>

<p>If the program already has associated "icon24x24.png" or
"icon48x48.png" resourcess, you'll need to replace them by typing the
following in a terminal window (assuming a 24x24 pixel icon):
</p>
<pre>rescopy -r &lt;application&gt; icon24x24.png icon24x24.png
</pre>

<p>This instructs rescopy to replace the "icon24x24.png" resource with
the "icon24x24.png" file you created. Replace "24x24" with "48x48" in
the above example to replace the 48x48 pixel icon.
</p>
<p>That's it!

</p>
<p></p><h3>More Information</h3>
<p></p>

<p>Syllable uses the Bluecurve icons for many of its icons.  You can <a href="http://msa.section.me.uk/syllable/bluecurve-icons.tar.gz">download the Bluecurve icons</a> for free; anybody can use them in any application.

</p>
<p>For more information on rescopy, type the following in a terminal window:

</p>
<pre>rescopy --help
</pre>

<p>NOTE: If rescopy quits with the error 'sh: objectcopy not found', install the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/syllable/DevelopersDelight.bin.4.tgz?download">Developer's Delight package</a>

</p>

<p id="tutorialname">Fixing screen resolution</p>
<p>Problem: In the settings dialog of the Screen I set the resolution
to 1280x1024, and now there appears a dialog on my monitor that says
the resolution is out of limit and I can do nothing after booting
Syllable.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong></p>

<p>Press <strong>Alt F12</strong>. If the screen still doesn't display, go to <strong>Solution 2</strong>. If it does, open up the screen preferences, click <strong>Default</strong>, and change <strong>Apply To</strong> to <em>All workspaces</em> and click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong></p>

<p>You'll need your Syllable installation CD to hand.</p>

<p>Boot from the CD and quit the installation script.  This will leave you with a shell running in a single ATerm.</p>

<p>Mount your existing Syllable partition. I'll assume that your
Syllable installation exists on /dev/disk/ata/hda/0, but you'll need to
change this to suit your system. To mount your Syllable partition, type:</p>

<div id="terminal">
mkdir /syllable<br>
mount /dev/disk/ata/hda/0 /syllable
</div>

<p>You now need to edit a single configuration file to restore your display.  The appserver configuration file can be found at:</p>

<p></p><div id="filetext">/syllable/atheos/sys/config/appserver</div><p></p>

<p>Open it in AEdit and you'll see that the first line of the config file is something like:</p>

<div id="filetext">
Desktop 00 =  1280  1024 80.00 50.00 70.00 80.00 60.00  RGB16 ""
</div>

<p>Change that line to match the others, e.g.:</p>

<div id="filetext">
Desktop 00 =  640  480 80.00 50.00 70.00 80.00 60.00  RGB16 ""
</div>

<p>Save the file. Now reboot (remove the CD) and Syllable will reboot
back into a 640x480 display, and you can try changing your display
settings again.</p>

<strong>Note</strong><div id="note">
Each line in the file consists of the following fields: Desktop number,
X, Y, horizontal position, vertical position, horizontal size, vertical
size, refresh rate, colorspace, and backdrop.
</div>


<p id="tutorialname">Turning off Numlock</p>
<p>Question: How can numlock be turned on at boot time?</p>

<p>At the moment, the only way to do it is to edit the keymap you are using.  To do that, follow these instructions:</p>

<p>I'll assume you're using the American keymap.  Copy it someplace you can work on it, e.g.:</p>

<div id="terminal">
cp /system/keymaps/American ~/
</div>

<p>Now run keymapconv:</p>

<div id="terminal">
cd ~<br>
keymapconv American American.txt
</div>

<p>Open American.txt in AEdit &amp; change the line "IntialKeyCaps=" to
"InitialKeyCaps=NumLock" Save the changes. Re-run keymapconv:</p>

<div id="terminal">
rm American<br>
keymapconv American.txt American
</div>

<p>Put the keymap back in <span id="filename">/system/keymaps/</span></p>

<div id="terminal">
mv American /system/keymaps/
</div>

<p>On your next reboot, the numlock won't be switched off by default.</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid rgb(18, 74, 141); padding: 5px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"><strong>Comments:</strong><br>
<hr>
Please change title to "Turning on Numlock" as the keymaps have turned off the numberlock by default for a long time now.

</div>
<p id="tutorialname">Creating a Decorator</p>
<p>To create a decorator:

</p>
<ol>
<li> Get the appserver source</li>
<li> Dive into system/sys/appserver/appserver/drivers/decorators</li>
<li> Copy one of the dirs</li>
<li> Hack away! :-)</li>
<p></p></ol>

<p></p>
<p>It's far easier to make a base a new decorator on existing code than
to write from scratch. It's recommended that you try any decorator
other than the Beish decorator, which is messy in places.
</p>
<p>The Win98 and Amiga decorators are fairly easy to play around with.
All of the decorators are built with vanilla drawing functions in C++;
there are no pixmaps involved.
</p>
<p>Essentially, you have a function which looks out for collisions (ie
mouse over corners), a function which return button presses, various
functions to draw the buttons, and a layout function which orders it
all. There's more to it than that &#8211; but they're easy to get started
with.
