<p id="tutorialname">An Introduction to Syllable</p>
<p>The basic vision of Syllable is simple:  A reliable and easy-to-use desktop operating system for home and small office users.

</p>
<p>First off, here's what Syllable is <em>not</em> :

</p>
<ol>
<li> Syllable is not competing with Windows or Linux.  Syllable's better than a mere copycat; Syllable forges its own path.</li>
<li> Syllable is not a platform for outrageous, experimental operating
system ideas. You should be comfortable in Syllable, not bewildered by
complex new paradigms.</li>
<li> Syllable is not exclusively for the experts. It's meant for
regular folks like you and me, while reserving plenty of power behind
the scenes for those with the knowledge.</li>
<li> Syllable is not bloated. It can boot in under 20 seconds on even old hardware.</li>
<p></p></ol>

<p></p>
<p>So, Syllable is intended to be a cool replacement for Windows or Linux on your desktop.

I'd build your own icon set and not rely on those Gnome ones. This
could be something like fluxbox on Damn Small, might free up some ram.
Probably a matter of taste. Anyway, well done for doing something
different. I'll try syl on Debian with vwplayer. J.Mc toggam@fsmail.net

What about compatability? -Ummu

<p id="tutorialname">Cool Features</p>
<p>What does Syllable give you that can't be found elsewhere?

</p>
<p>First off, operating systems like Windows and MacOS have lots of
legacy code to ensure that old software works properly. Syllable, on
the other hand, isn't weighted down by the code needed to support
decades' worth of old software. This helps make Syllable responsive and
lightweight.
</p>
<p>Secondly, Syllable uses a cool file system called AFS, which can
store lots of common data (metadata) about files and lets you make
searches on them like a database.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, Syllable is POSIX-compliant. This means that Syllable can
run a lot of tried-and-true Unix software, without needing tons of code
to support it.
</p>
<p>Forthly, Syllable boots very quickly even on old computers and has low RAM requirements.

</p>
<p>For developers, Syllable provides a clean, completely object-oriented programming API that's a dream to program in.

</p>
<p>Syllable is currently being developed, but is relatively stable and
mature. A number of useful Syllable applications are already available,
and Syllable supports a wide range of common hardware device, including
video, network, and sound cards from manufacturers such as Intel, AMD,
3Com, nVidia, 3DFX, Matrox, and Creative. If you would like to see a
more comprehensive list of supported hardware, see here:

<hr>Judging from the first 'feature'... you don't expect Syllable to be
developped for a decade? In stead we should all install a new OS every
decade which doesn't have to support a decade of old software... hmm...
<hr>heh. linux is nice for me for now tho. i wanna start a
syllable-liek project eventually :D. also one thing that annoys me
about sylllable is that it has too many references to atheos. screw
atheos, who cares if its compatible lol.
<hr>I dont think its an atempt to be compatible, i think its just
taking advantage of work already well done (see re-inventing the wheel)
<hr>i DONT like the coding style of the APIs!
i would have preffered this format: ClassName::functionName() instead
of ClassName::FunctionName. other than that the OO design is cool
<hr>i don't like how there's an object-oriented API! sure, make it
object-oriented in nature, but don't force people to use C++ and your
libraries just for that!
<hr>

<hr>About the first comment: These are modern times. I think we are
able to plan ahead more, with the methods we have now. I'm not saying
programming methods won't improve, but I'm just saying the basic
structure of these things won't change for a long time. </div>
<p id="tutorialname">Syllable History</p>
<p>The Syllable project dates back to July 2002, but the story begins well before that.

</p>
<p>The history of Syllable really begins with an operating system named
BeOS, which was developed throughout the 1990's by a small company
named Be made up primarily of former Apple employees who were
dissatisfied with the direction of Apple. They developed BeOS as a
modern, powerful speed demon of an operating system that was
particularly suited for heavy multimedia applications (you should have
seen a BeOS machine running thirty simultaneous videos, smooth as
butter).
</p>
<p>Though Be was eventually bought out by Palm and BeOS was liquidated,
it inspired a young programmer named Kurt Skauen in his efforts to
create a hobby operating system. In the late 90's and early 00's, he
created AtheOS, borrowing heavily from BeOS' file system and
programming API.
</p>
<p>After a few years, Kurt abandoned AtheOS to pursue other dreams. In
July 2002, a team of devoted AtheOS enthusiasts forked AtheOS and made
Syllable.
</p>
<p>Since then, the Syllable development team has been working to polish
Kurt's work and turn it into a general-purpose operating system that
anyone can use.

<hr>Huh? From what I remember, Kurt began AtheOS before the BeBox was
shipped in 1995. He was inspired to create an AmigaOS clone after
Commodore went down... as he was an Amigan. He probably didn't even
know BeOS existed at that stage.
<hr>Yes, this is all rather mysterious. AtheOS was largely rewritten
several times, and the above story pertains to the last version, that
became Syllable. I would like to know more dates, too.

<hr>Hmm I remember reading somewhere that AtheOS was started 3 months
after Commodore went broke. That'd date AtheOS to July/August 1994. I
guess the only person who'd know for sure is Kurt himself.
<hr>


<hr>
From http://www.atheos.cx/: (Kurt's words?) "I started working on AtheOS before the first BeBox was shipped."

That was either Jan or Aug 1996 according to http://www.bebox.nu/history.php

And I too never heard that AtheOS had anything to do with BeOS.  Indeed, I thought it was *loosely* Amiga-inspired.

<hr>
It reminds me somewhat of BeOS, but it definitely has a destinct fragrance of Amiga.

Kristian Poul Herkild

<hr>The timeline of Syllable begins with AtheOS:
early 1990s: Kurt Skauen is inspired by the Amiga to create his own
hobby OS.
1994: as Commodore goes broke, Kurt becomes an Amigan - he learns about
the inner workings of the Amiga, juggling study time at school while
learning the intricacies of his favorite computer system.
early 1996: Kurt creates AtheOS almost from scratch. August 1996: BeBox
introduced to the world. It borrows alot from Amiga and UNIX.
1997-2002: AtheOS gains fans who forked it as Syllable.
2002: A revised history of Syllable is created, which ties Syllable to
BeOS by creating the mythology that AtheOS was influenced by BeOS.
Actually, Kurt's early experience with Amiga inspired him to create
AtheOS from scratch.
Today, Syllable carries on the legacy of AtheOS with the invigorating
aroma of BeOS, and the subtle flavor of Amiga.
<hr>It was the 133MHz BeBox that came out in August 1996 - the
original 66MHz BeBox was released in 1995 although apparently not in
large numbers. I can confirm by searching archives that people were
purchasing BeBoxes in 1995. It seems unlikely that a programmer would
become an Amigan only after Commodore went broke.
