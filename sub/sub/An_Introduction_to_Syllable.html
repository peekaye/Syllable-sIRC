<p>The basic vision of Syllable is simple:  A reliable and easy-to-use desktop operating system for home and small office users.

</p>
<p>First off, here's what Syllable is <em>not</em> :

</p>
<ol>
<li> Syllable is not competing with Windows or Linux.  Syllable's better than a mere copycat; Syllable forges its own path.</li>
<li> Syllable is not a platform for outrageous, experimental operating
system ideas. You should be comfortable in Syllable, not bewildered by
complex new paradigms.</li>
<li> Syllable is not exclusively for the experts. It's meant for
regular folks like you and me, while reserving plenty of power behind
the scenes for those with the knowledge.</li>
<li> Syllable is not bloated. It can boot in under 20 seconds on even old hardware.</li>
<p></p></ol>

<p></p>
<p>So, Syllable is intended to be a cool replacement for Windows or Linux on your desktop.
