<div id="sectiontext">Introduction to Various Driver Types</div>

<p>If we speak about writing drivers, we have to divide our attention
between kernel drivers and appserver drivers. Kernel drivers are used
for hardware like sound cards, network cards, and file system add-ons.
Graphics drivers and the high-level part of input drivers are handled
by the appserver. While kernel drivers are written in C, appserver
addons are written in C++. Common to both is that they are simple ELF
modules, which are loaded if necessary. Unlike some UNIX systems,
Syllable has a defined interface between the drivers and the
kernel/appserver, which is not changed very often.</p>
<p>Please note that you have to be careful when writing drivers,
because a bug in a driver can cause the system to lock up and make it
completely unusable. If you can, you should have a second Syllable
installation, which you can use to remove invalid drivers, or <a href="Booting_from_the_Install_CD.html">boot from the install CD</a>.</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Basic description</div>

<p>Device drivers in Syllable are abstracted through the filesystem in
much the same way as in UNIX. All device drivers export their
functionality through special files in the /dev/ directory, or in a
sub-directory of /dev/. Unlike in traditional UNIXes, the /dev/
directory in Syllable is hierarchial, and is very dynamic in that
device drivers can add and remove nodes at runtime if, for example, the
driver controls a removable device that might be added or removed after
the driver is initialized.</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Driver initialization</div>

<p>A driver is just an ELF binary built in much the same way as a
regular DLL. When a driver is loaded by the kernel it will search for a
exported symbol named "device_init" and call it to allow the driver to
initialize itself. The <code>device_init()</code> function is passed a
unique device ID that is dynamically assigned to each driver when
loaded and used by the kernel to identify the driver later.</p>

<p>Just before the driver is unloaded, the kernel will look for a global function named <code>device_uninit()</code> and, if found, it will be called to allow the driver to clean up.</p>

<p><code>device_init()</code> and <code>device_uninit()</code> are the
only functions that will be called directly by the kernel. For the
driver to do any usefull work, it must export one or more device-nodes
through the Syllable Device FS. This is a logical file system that is
mounted at <span id="filename">/dev/</span> and controll all devices. Each device is present as a magic file located in <span id="filename">/dev/</span> or a sub-directory of <span id="filename">/dev/</span>. Initially <span id="filename">/dev/</span> only contain <span id="filename">/dev/null</span> and <span id="filename">/dev/zero</span> which is controlled by the Syllable VFS itself. All other directory and device-nodes are created by device drivers.</p>

<p>A device driver can create a device-node with <code>create_device_node()</code> and remove it with <code>delete_device_node()</code>.
When creating a device node, the driver must provide a function pointer
table with entry points to the driver's functionality. The functions in
the table will be called by the Syllable VFS to control the device. The
most important functions are <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, and <code>ioctl()</code>, but there are also functions to open/close the device, as well as functions called by <code>select()</code> to make it possible for one thread to wait for IO on multiple devices.</p>

<p>A typical device driver will create one node in <code>device_init()</code> and delete it again in <code>device_uninit()</code>.</p>

<br><span id="codenumber">21</span> <font color="#4444ff">}</font>
<br></div>

<div id="sectiontext">How a driver is located</div>

<p>Since the nodes inside <code>/dev/</code> are created by the device
drivers themself and not by the kernel, it is not directly obvious what
driver should be loaded if an application tries to open, for example, <span id="filename">/dev/video/cpia</span>.</p>
<p>If this is the first time someone attempts to open the CPiA device, the driver is not loaded and <span id="filename">/dev/video/cpia</span> does not exist. If this is the first time anything inside <span id="filename">/dev/</span> is touched, the <span id="filename">/dev/video</span> directory doesn't exist either.</p>
<p>To make it possible for the kernel to search for drivers in a
efficient way, the driver binaries are located in a directory tree
similar to the resulting tree inside <span id="filename">/dev/</span>. For example, the CPiA driver from the above example whould be located in <span id="filename">/system/drivers/dev/video/cpia</span>.</p>
<p>If the kernel is asked to open <span id="filename">/dev/video/cpia</span>, it would start by opening the <span id="filename">/dev</span> directory, which would cause the <span id="filename">/system/drivers/dev</span>
directory to be iterated. During the iteration, all drivers found will
attempt to load and initiate, and all directories will be replicated
inside <span id="filename">/dev/</span>. Since <span id="filename">/system/drivers/dev</span> contains a directory named <span id="filename">video</span>, this will cause <span id="filename">/dev/video</span> to be created. When <span id="filename">/dev/</span> is successfully opened, it will attempt to open <span id="filename">/dev/video</span>, which should now exist. Opening <span id="filename">/dev/video</span> will cause the <span id="filename">/system/drivers/dev/video</span> directory to be iterated and the <span id="filename">cpia</span> binary to be loaded. The CPiA driver will then probe for a CPiA device and, if found, will create a device node named <span id="filename">/dev/video/cpia</span>, which will then be found and opened when the kernel descends into the <span id="filename">/dev/video</span> directory.</p>
<p>In the trivial example above, there was direct match between the name of the driver and the name of the device inside <span id="filename">/dev</span>.
Since one driver might export more than one device, this is not always
the case. For example, an IDE disk driver would export one device for
each disk connected to the bus and one device for each partition found
on those disks. The device-tree exported by an IDE driver might look
something like this:</p>

<pre>/dev/disk/hda/raw
/dev/disk/hda/0
/dev/disk/hda/1
/dev/disk/hdb/raw
/dev/disk/hdc/raw
/dev/disk/hdc/0
</pre>

<p>In this case, the IDE driver should be located in <span id="filename">/system/drivers/dev/disk/ide</span>. If someone attempts to open the first partition on the master disk connected to the first controller, it would have to open <span id="filename">/dev/disk/ide/hda/0</span>.</p>

<p>When descending the path, the kernel will first create the <span id="filename">/dev/disk</span> and <span id="filename">/dev/disk/ide</span>
directories. Then it will load the ide-driver which will detect that
there are 3 disks connected to the two controllers before decoding the
partition tables and add all the nodes listed above. At this point, <span id="filename">/dev/disk/ide/hda/0 already exists and no other drivers need to be loaded to fulfill the request.</span></p>

<div id="sectiontext">Using busmanagers</div>

<p>To keep the kernel small and avoid recompiling when adding support
for new hardware technology, the management code for busses like PCI
and USB lives in kernel modules called busmanagers. These busmanagers
are loaded by the bootmanager if they are necessary for loading the
system (e.g., the PCI busmanager is necessary for the IDE driver) or
later after the root disk is mounted. Using busmanagers from drivers is
really easy: You just have to ask the kernel to give you access to a
busmanager with a specific name and the API version you support. If you
would like to access the PCI bus, maybe to scan for supported devices,
you would do something like this:</p>

<div id="codelisting">
<span id="codenumber"> 1</span> PCI_bus_s* psBus = get_busmanager<font color="#4444ff">(</font> PCI_BUS_NAME, PCI_BUS_VERSION <font color="#4444ff">)</font>;
<br><span id="codenumber"> 2</span> if<font color="#4444ff">(</font> psBus == NULL <font color="#4444ff">)</font>
<br><span id="codenumber"> 3</span> <font color="#4444ff">{</font>
<br><span id="codenumber"> 4</span>         // handle error
<br><span id="codenumber"> 5</span> <font color="#4444ff">}</font>
<br></div>

<p>You would now have a pointer to a <code>PCI_bus_s</code> structure,
which is defined in the PCI busmanager header file and contains
pointers to the busmanager's functions. Access to the USB bus works
similar, alhough of course the functions in the <code>USB_bus_s</code> structure are different.</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Device management</div>

<p>Although the Syllable kernel driver interface is easy to use, it has
one problem: Two device drivers may try to access one device. Also, the
kernel does not know what devices are supported by the drivers and so
cannot show a list of supported/unsupported hardware to the user. To
solve these problems, the kernel contains a special device manager. A
device can be registered by any device driver or busmanager and is
later claimed by the driver that wants to access the device. All later
tries by other drivers to claim the device will fail, and so the driver
knows that it should not use this device. If you write a PCI or USB
device driver, the busmanager can give you the handles to the devices
it knows. All you have to do is to call the <code>claim_device()</code> function:</p>

<div id="codelisting">
<span id="codenumber"> 1</span> int nHandle = sMyDevice.nHandle // get Handle from the busmanager
<br><span id="codenumber"> 2</span> if<font color="#4444ff">(</font> claim_device<font color="#4444ff">(</font> nDeviceID, // device ID of the driver
<br><span id="codenumber"> 3</span>                   nHandle,
<br><span id="codenumber"> 4</span>                   "My device", // name for the device
<br><span id="codenumber"> 5</span>                   DEVICE_AUDIO <font color="#4444ff">)</font> // type of the device
<br><span id="codenumber"> 6</span>     != 0 <font color="#4444ff">)</font> <font color="#4444ff">{</font>
<br><span id="codenumber"> 7</span>         // handle error
<br><span id="codenumber"> 8</span> <font color="#4444ff">}</font>
<br></div>

<p>Please note that if you support hardware that can be removed while
the computer is running (such as USB devices), you have to call <code>release_device( nHandle )</code> if the busmanager informs you about the removal.</p>
<p>If you want to support hardware which is not managed by any busmanager, you can call <code>register_device()</code> yourself:</p>

<div id="codelisting">
<span id="codenumber"> 1</span> int nHandle = register_device<font color="#4444ff">(</font> "My device", // name
<br><span id="codenumber"> 2</span>                                <font class="stringliteral">"isa"</font> <font color="#4444ff">)</font>; // busname
<br><span id="codenumber"> 3</span> claim_device<font color="#4444ff">(</font> nDeviceID, nHandle, "My device", DEVICE_AUDIO <font color="#4444ff">)</font>;
<br></div>

<p>This will not prevent two drivers to access one device, but it will show some nice information to the user.</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Reducing boottime by disabling PCI device drivers</div>

<p>To avoid unnecessary attempts to load drivers, it is possible to
disable device drivers. This feature is only available for pure PCI
device drivers. If you did not find any supported hardware, you should
call <code>disable_device( nDeviceID )</code>. This will disable the device driver until the PCI busmanager detects a hardware change.</p>

<div id="sectiontext">Busmanager Drivers</div>

<a name="sec_bus_1"><h2>Structure of a busmanager</h2></a>

<p>A busmanager is a normal kernel module that is located in the <span id="filename">/system/drivers/bus</span> directory . Unlike the kernel device drivers, it does not export <span id="filename">device_init()</span> and <span id="filename">device_uninit()</span>. Instead, the following functions need to be implemented:</p>

<div id="codelisting">
<span id="codenumber"> 1</span> status_t bus_init<font color="#4444ff">(</font><font color="#4444ff">)</font>;
<br><span id="codenumber"> 2</span> void     bus_uninit<font color="#4444ff">(</font><font color="#4444ff">)</font>;
<br><span id="codenumber"> 3</span> void*    bus_get_hooks<font color="#4444ff">(</font> <font class="keywordtype">int</font> nVersion <font color="#4444ff">)</font>;
<br></div>

<p>The <code>bus_init()</code> function should initialize the busmanager and do a device scan on the bus if possible. Then <code>register_device()</code>
should be called for the found devices. If the bus does not support
hotplugging, the busmanager should also load a previously saved list of
the attached devices and compare it with the current configuration. If
it detects any change, the busmanager should call <code>enable_all_devices()</code> so that device drivers which use this busmanager can safely disable themselves. If the initialization of the bus fails, <code>bus_init()</code> should return a value != 0.</p>

<p><code>bus_uninit()</code> is called during shutdown. The busmanager can save a list of the currently attached devices here using the <code>write_config_entry...()</code> functions of the kernel.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>bus_get_hooks()</code> returns a pointer to a private
structure that will probably contain pointers to the busmanager's
functions. The busmanager should respect the <code>nVersion</code> flags to keep backward compatibility with older drivers.</p>

It looks as if the article on video drivers was somehow merged with the
article on "general" device drivers. If this was intentional, the video
driver part needs a more noticeable headline - I was quite surprised by
the sudden change of topic until I realized that there were basically
two articles lumped together :)
