<p>What does Syllable give you that can't find elsewhere?

</p>
<p>First off, operating systems like Windows and MacOS have lots of
legacy code to ensure that old software works properly. Syllable, on
the other hand, isn't weighted down by the code needed to support
decades' worth of old software. This makes Syllable responsive and
lightweight.
</p>
<p>Secondly, Syllable uses a cool file system called AFS, which can
store lots of common data about files and lets you make searches on
them like a database.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, Syllable is POSIX-compliant. This means that Syllable can
run a lot of tried-and-true Unix software, without needing tons of code
to support it.
</p>
<p>For developers, Syllable provides a clean, completely object-oriented programming API that's a dream to program in.

</p>
<p>Syllable is currently being developed, but is stable and relatively
mature. A number of useful Syllable applications are already available,
and Syllable supports a wide range of common hardware device, including
video, network, and sound cards from manufacturers such as Intel, AMD,
3Com, nVidia, and Creative. If you would like to see a more
comprehensive list of supported hardware, search <a href="http://azaka.nutus.com.ar/">Azaka</a>

Judging from the first 'feature'... you don't expect Syllable to be
developped for a decade? In stead we should all install a new OS every
decade which doesn't have to support a decade of old software... hmm...
<hr>heh. linux is nice for me for now tho. i wanna start a
syllable-liek project eventually :D. also one thing that annoys me
about sylllable is that it has too many references to atheos. screw
atheos, who cares if its compatible lol.
<hr>I dont think its an atempt to be compatible, i think its just
taking advantage of work already well done (see re-inventing the wheel)
<hr>i DONT like the coding style of the APIs!
i would have preffered this format: ClassName::functionName() instead
of ClassName::FunctionName. other than that the OO design is cool
<hr>i don't like how there's an object-oriented API! sure, make it
object-oriented in nature, but don't force people to use C++ and your
libraries just for that!
<hr>
'It hauty tone' "I'm starting my own OS too, I like the look of your OS.. havn't installed it yet just reading up on it
