<p></p><h3>Syllable OS Development Introduction</h3>
<p></p>

<p>Welcome to Syllable!  We're glad you want to help out.

</p>
<p>First of all, you'll need some basic development tools.  You have two options:

</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55553&amp;package_id=85852">Download Developer's Delight</a>, which contains all of the most common packages you'll need, though they may not always be the most up-to-date versions. OR</li>
<li> Download the individual packages you want from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55553">the Syllable website</a>.  At a minimum these should be:</li>
<ul>
<li> Gcc 3.3 or newer</li>
<li> Binutils 2.14 or newer</li>
<li> The latest version of make</li>
<p></p></ul>
</ul>

<p></p>
<p>Read the README included in the Developer Pack for installation
instructions. Note that, if you're downloading the Developer Pack 4 for
0.6.0, get a copy of libgcc_s.so.1 and put it in /system/lib/. It'll be
on the install CD, or in 0.5.7.
</p>
<p>Those are the minimum you would need to build C or C++ software, but
if you also want to build the kernel or deal with third party source
code, the following packages may also be required:
</p>
<ul>
<li> nasm</li>
<li> Autoconf</li>
<li> Perl</li>
<li> Diffutils</li>
<li> Ruby (needed to install Builder)</li>
<p></p></ul>

<p></p>
<p>You should probably download the latest CVS package in order to access the Syllable CVS repository, including Builder.

</p>
<p>Retrieve Builder from CVS:

</p>
<pre>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/syllable co syllable/system/apps/utils/Builder
</pre>

<p>Retrieve from CVS two files which are used by some of the system Makefiles:

</p>
<pre>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/syllable co syllable/system/makefile.rules
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/syllable co syllable/system/recurse.rules
</pre>

<p>These two files should go in /usr/src  Also modify /etc/profile and
set the ATHEOS_SRC environment variable to point to /usr/src.  Directly
below this, add:

</p>
<pre>export ATHEOS_INCLUDE_PATH=/ainc
</pre>

<p>Close and re-open your terminal window for these changes to take effect.

</p>
<p>Some code may require extra libraries.  For example, libogg, libpng, etc. are
required by some parts of Syllable.  You would need to download and
install these as needed.
