<p>Installing Syllable from the Premium CD or Basic CD is a snap.

</p>
<p>First, make sure you have a hard drive &#8211; or a partition of a hard drive &#8211; available to install Syllable on.

</p>
<p>What's a partition? Hard drives can be split up into separate pieces
called partitions. Each partition can be formatted and used as though
it were a separate hard drive. So, you could have a 60 GB hard drive
with three partitions on it; one 20 GB partition for Windows, another
20 GB partition for Linux, and of course a 20 GB partition for
Syllable.
</p>
<p>Then, insert the CD in the computer's CD-ROM drive and reboot. The
computer should boot and display the Syllable Installation Menu.
</p>
<p>If the CD does not boot, this is likely because the computer does
not read the CD-ROM before booting from the hard drive. Reboot again
and press the key or keys to access your BIOS (look on the screen for a
message that explains how to do this; different BIOS manufacturers use
different keys, though the most common ones are <strong>Del</strong>, <strong>F8</strong>, and <strong>F10</strong>).
Once you're viewing the BIOS, navigate until you find the section that
deals with the boot sequence. Change the boot sequence (again, the
exact procedure for doing this varies widely by manufacturer) so that
the CD-ROM drive is booted before the hard drive is booted.
</p>
<p><strong>Installing Syllable</strong>

</p>
<p>Once you're in the Syllable Installation Menu, press any key to bypass the main screen.

</p>
<p>First, you'll need to choose the hard drive and partition on which
you want to install Syllable. The Installation Menu will display a list
of partitions; just type the name of the partition on which you want to
install Syllable. This partition will then be formatted (all data on it
will be erased, and it will be set up for Syllable). Syllable will then
install its files onto the newly formatted partition.
</p>
<p>But wait!  You're not done yet.

</p>
<p><strong>Installing GRUB</strong>

</p>
<p>Once Syllable is installed, you'll still need to install GRUB, which
lets you boot into Syllable. To do this, reboot with the CD still in
the drive. When you get the GRUB boot menu, press the <strong>C</strong> key and you'll be presented with a GRUB menu.

</p>
<p>To set up GRUB, you'll need to figure out two numbers at this point:
the hard drive number and the partition number for Syllable. If you
installed on hda (the first hard drive in the computer), the hard drive
number is 0. If you installed on hdb, the hard drive number is 1.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if you installed on the first partition on the hard
drive, the partition number is 0. If you installed on the second
partition, the number is 1, and so on.
</p>
<p>To install GRUB, you need to enter the following two commands, which
assume that you're installing on the first partition of the first hard
drive (hd0,0). If you were installing on the third partition of the
second hard drive, you'd use (hd1,2).
</p>
<p>Type the following commands at the GRUB menu:

</p>
<pre>root (hd0,0)
setup (hd0,0)
</pre>

<p>You should see something like this:

</p>
<pre>grub&gt; root (hd0,0)
Filesystem tyep is afs, partition type 0xeb

grub&gt; setup (hd0,0)
Checking if "/boot/grub/stage1" exists... yes
Checking if "/boot/grub/stage2" exists... yes
Checking if "/boot/grub/afs_stage1_5" exists... yes
Running "embed /boot/grub/afs_stage1_5 (hd0,0)"...  19 sectors are embedded. succeeded
Running "install /boot/grub/stage1 (hd0,0) (hd0,0)4+19 p (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage2 /boot/grub/menu.lst"... succeeded
Done.
</pre>


<p>Now remove the CD and reboot.  Syllable should boot correctly.

<hr>I had Lilo installed as the boot loader before I installed
Syllable. The Lilo boot loader is still trying to boot the system (but
there is no Linux kernel for it to load).
<hr>Install grub overtop if you can I would geuss.. disable your
harddrive as a boot option put your CD first,, could be mistaken but if
you isntall grub overtop this should do it.. (I'm geussing)
