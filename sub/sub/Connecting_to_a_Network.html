<p>To connect to a network, you'll need to know a few things:

</p>
<ul>
<li> Your Primary DNS (Domain Name Service) server</li>
<li> Your Secondary DNS server, if you have one</li>
<li> Whether your network uses DHCP or not.  If your network does not use DHCP, you will also need to know:</li>
<ul>
<li> Your computer's IP address</li>
<li> The network's netmask (usually 255.255.255.255 or 255.255.255.0)</li>
<p></p></ul>
</ul>

<p></p>
<p>On the desktop, double-click the <strong>Preferences</strong> icon.  The Preferences window is displayed.  Double-click the <strong>Network</strong> icon.  The Network Preferences window is displayed:

</p>
<p></p><center><img src="../files/network_prefs.png" alt="[IMAGE]"></center>

<p></p>
<p>In the <strong>Host</strong> field, type a name for this computer.  This field is optional.

</p>
<p>The <strong>Domain</strong> field is optional; if you want, you can type in the name of the network.

</p>
<p>In the <strong>Primary DNS</strong> field, type in the name of your primary Domain Name Server.  This is often 192.168.1.1.

</p>
<p>If your network has a secondary DNS, enter it in the <strong>Secondary DNS</strong> field.

</p>
<p>If the <strong>Network Interfaces</strong> field is blank, no
network card was found in your PC, and you won't be able to get online.
If a network card was found, it will be displayed as eth0. Select it
and click the <strong>Modify</strong> button.  The <strong>Network Interface</strong> window is displayed.

</p>
<p>If your network uses DHCP, click the <strong>Use DHCP</strong>
checkbox, then close the window. DHCP is a service that allows the
computer to request its IP address and netmask from the DNS server.
With this checkbox checked, all the information in this window will be
received from the DNS server, so all the fields are disabled.
</p>
<p>If your network does not use DHCP, enter this computer's IP address in the <strong>IP Address</strong> field, and the network's netmask in the <strong>Netmask</strong> field, then close the window.

</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Apply</strong> button to save the changes you've made to your network preferences.  You should now be connected to the network.

</p>

<p>On the command line, you must edit <em>/atheos/sys/net_init.sh</em> so it looks like:
</p><pre>#!bin/sh
ifconfig eth0 inet [your_ip] netmask [your_mask]
route add net [your_ip] mask 0.0.0.0 gw [your_gateway]
</pre>

<p></p>
<p>and <em>/etc/resolv.conf</em> as follows:
</p><pre>nameserver [primary_dns]
nameserver [secondary_dns]
</pre>

<p></p>
<p>and then just reboot or run <em>/atheos/sys/net_init.sh</em>.

</p>
