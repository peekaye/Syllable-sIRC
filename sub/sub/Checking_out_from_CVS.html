<p>Let's say you want to get syllable/system/sys/kernel and everything
in it. With Sourceforge, you don't need to use "login" to access the
repository. You just go ahead and checkout. So: </p>
<pre>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/syllable checkout syllable/system/sys/kernel/kernel 
</pre>

<p>Only the last part, after the "checkout", ever needs to change. Note
the exact format of the -d argument. No spaces after the -d and the
first colon is important. </p>
<p>Once you have a copy checked out, you'll have a local folder in your current directory called "syllable", so if you're in <em>/Source, you'll now have </em>/Source/syllable/system/sys/kernel/kernel/.
If, in the future, you want to update your local copy to the latest
version in CVS, just go to the directory you want to update and run </p>
<pre>cvs update 
</pre>

<p>CVS will know which repository etc. you used last time, so there is
no need for the -d argument; it will automatically fetch the latest
files for you. </p><div style="border: 1px solid rgb(18, 74, 141); padding: 5px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"><strong>Comments:</strong><br>

CVS stores projects and files in a central repository, but you work
from a working copy, called a sandbox, in your local directories. You
create that sandbox with cvs checkout.
CVS creates the sandbox as a subdirectory of your current working
directory. I like to create a directory to contain all my CVS
sandboxes, and I use ~/cvs. From whichever directory you want a sandbox
created in, run the command:
cvs -d repository_path checkout project_name
This command checks out all files for the named project. If your
repository is on the local machine, the repository path is the full
pathname of the CVS repository. If your repository is on a remote
server, see the earlier Section 2.4. Example 2-10 shows a local
checkout.
Example 2-10. Local repository checkout
$ mkdir ~/cvs
$ cd ~/cvs
$ cvs -d /var/lib/cvsroot checkout example
cvs checkout: Updating example
U example/file1
U example/file2
The checkout command puts a copy of the project's files and
subdirectories into a directory named for the project, created in the
current working directory. It also puts some administrative files of
its own in a subdirectory of the project directory, called CVS.
You can check out an individual file or subdirectory of a project by
replacing project_name with the pathname to the file or directory, from
the project's root directory. See Chapter 3 for more information.
CVS stores the repository path as part of the sandbox, so you should
never again need to use -d repository_path in commands executed within
that sandbox.
If you are checking out a sandbox from a remote repository, the
repository path is slightly different than the path shown in the
previous example. Example 2-11 shows a checkout from a remote
repository.
Example 2-11. Remote repository checkout
$ cvs -d :ext:cvs:/home/cvs checkout cvsbook
cvs server: Updating cvsbook
U cvsbook/1-introduction.html
U cvsbook/2-installation.html
