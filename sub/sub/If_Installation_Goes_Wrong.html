<p id="tutorialname">Troubleshooting</p>
<p></p><h2>Syllable boots from the install floppies and into the GUI,
but when I try to mount an existing FAT partition or format the AFS
partition, it appear that Syllable has not detected any of my
partitions. What can I do?</h2>
<p></p>

<p>The problem is most likely related to the way your BIOS translates
disk addresses compared to the OS you normally access the disk from.
Experiment with the BIOS settings for the disk in question. Most
BIOS'es provide LBA, and a few CHS modes. Try the various modes and see
if you can find one that matches the translation your OS is using.
</p>
<p></p><h2>It's asking me to log in.  What's the username and password?</h2>
<p></p>

<p>There are two accounts defined in a standard Syllable installation.
One account has the username "root" and the password "root". This is
the "super-user" that give you access to everything. The other account
has the username "guest" and the password "guest". This is a regular
user and serves as an example of standard accounts on Syllable.
</p>
<p></p><h2>When I try to boot from the CD I get the error 'Cannot exec boot-shell'</h2>
<p></p>

<p>"Cannot exec boot-shell" probably means that Syllable could not
detect the CD-ROM drive that you are booting Syllable from. This is a
known problem with the ATAPI driver &amp; some slow CD-ROM drives; the
ATAPI driver does not correctly identify when a device is in the
process of "Becoming Ready" and instead returns a "Not Ready" or
"Unable to read capacity" error. 0.4.5 is <em>slightly</em> better at dealing with this than 0.4.4 was, but it still may not work.

</p>
<p>What you need to do is pass the exact path to your boot CD-ROM to
the Syllable kernel, rather than allowing it to attempt to detect your
boot device. There are two possible ways to go about this.
</p>
<p>1) If you don't mind doing this every time you wish to boot from CD,
you can simply change the arguments at boot time. Boot from the CD and
when the Grub boot-menu is displayed, press <strong>E</strong> to enter the Grub editor. Move down to the second line which begins

</p>
<pre>kernel=
</pre>

<p>Press <strong>E</strong> again to edit this line. Scroll back along the line until you come to the argument

</p>
<pre>root=@boot
</pre>

<p>Delete the "@boot" part of the argument, and instead enter the
device path for your CD-ROM drive (See below for information on how to
work out what your CD-ROM drive is called)
</p>
<p>Once you have entered the correct path to your CD-ROM drive, press <strong>B</strong>
to boot with your edited configuration file. Syllable should now boot
and correctly find your boot CD, and continue to boot into the Syllable
installation script.
</p>
<p>2) If you think you'll need to boot from the CD several times, or
you do not want to edit the parameters from within Grub, you can create
a boot floppy and edit the Grub boot menu with any text editor. On the
CD the boot disk image can be found at
</p>
<pre>/boot/boot.img
</pre>

<p>You can write this to a 1.44MB floppy disk with either "dd" under
*nix, Syllable or BeOS or with rawwrite under Windows. With "dd" you
would write the disk with E.g.
</p>
<pre>dd if=/mnt/cdrom/boot/boot.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=512
</pre>

<p>Once dd has finished, mount the floppy disk as a FAT32 disk. On the disk you can find the Grub boot menu configuration file at

</p>
<pre>/boot/grub/menu.lst
</pre>

<p>Open this file in your prefered editor and Move down to the second line which begins

</p>
<pre>kernel=
</pre>

<p>Edit this line and find the argument

</p>
<pre>root=@boot
</pre>

<p>Delete the "@boot" part of the argument, and instead enter the
device path for your CD-ROM drive (See below for information on how to
work out what your CD-ROM drive is called)
</p>
<p>Once you have entered the correct path to your CD-ROM drive, save
your edited configuration file. You can now boot from the boot floppy
disk (With the boot CD in the correct drive) and Syllable should boot
and correctly find your boot CD, and continue to boot into the Syllable
installation script. Ensure that you have correctly set your BIOS to
boot from the floppy disk first, and not from the CD-ROM!
</p>
<p>Syllable names the drives as follows:

</p>
<ul>
<li> cda - CD or DVD on the Primary Master</li>
<li> cdb - CD or DVD on the Primary Slave</li>
<li> cdc - CD or DVD on the Secondary Master</li>
<li> cdd - CD or DVD on the Secondary Slave</li>
<p></p></ul>

<p></p>
<p>Most PCs have the CD-ROM drive on the Secondary Master, which would make the full device path

</p>
<pre>/dev/disk/ata/cdc/raw
</pre>

<p>which would make the root= argument

</p>
<pre>root=/dev/disk/ata/cdc/raw
</pre>

<p></p><h2>Syllable has detected my network card, but it doesn't work.</h2>
<p></p>

<p>First of all, ensure that your network settings are correct. Run the
command ifconfig in an ATerm, which will show you your current network
configuration. Also check the kernel log in /var/log/kernel for errors.
</p>
<p>If there are no obvious errors and your network configuration is
correct, ensure that "Plug and Play OS" is disabled in your computer's
BIOS. This option is only useful if you are running an old versions of
Microsoft Windows and can cause all sorts of strange errors with modern
operating systems.

<p id="tutorialname">Capturing Debugging Output</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Syllable is undergoing rapid development, which means that sometimes
things don't work quite as they should. Whether it's unsupported
hardware or a new feature that's causing problems, debugging output can
be captured and sent to the syllable developer mailing list. This will
help the developers improve Syllable and hopefully get your
installation working properly. To do this you will need a second
computer and a null-modem serial cable. If you've got this equipment
then you're ready to start.</p>

<h2>Adding the kernel parameters</h2>

<p>First you will need to enable the debugging output on your Syllable machine. Add the following to the kernel parameters:</p>

<div id="filetext">
debug_enable debug_port=1 debug_baudrate=19200 debug_plaintext=true
</div>

<p>You can do this by editing menu.lst (/boot/boot/grub/menu.lst). The kernel line should now look something like this:

</p><div id="filetext">
kernel /atheos/sys/kernel.so root=/dev/disk/ide/hda/0 debug_enable debug_port=1 debug_baudrate=19200 debug_plaintext=true
</div>

<h2>Setting up the serial terminal</h2>
<p>Now you've setup your Syllable machine to output the debugging
information, you will need to set up the other machine. You will need a
serial terminal program. You can use the following programs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linux - Minicom</li>
<li>Windows - Teraterm</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to setup your terminal to receive at 19200bps (8N1). More details for each terminal program are below.</p>

<h3>Linux - Minicom</h3>

<p>Depending on your distribution the key combination to configure
Minicom will vary. Once the program is running in the bottom left-hand
corner it will say "[key / key combination] Z for help". This special
key or key combination will be called the <b>command key</b> during this tutorial.</p>

<p>Press the command key followed by O to bring up the configuration
menu. Select "Serial port setup". Press A to set the serial port,
normally you should set this to "/dev/ttyS0". Now press E to select the
baud rate and protocol. Set the Speed to "19200", then press Q to set
the protocol.</p>

<p>Now go back out to the configuration menu. Save the configuration.
You may find you need to exit (command key followed by Q) and restart
Minicom for the settings to take effect. Press the command key followed
by L. Type in the name of the file you wish to log the debugging output
to. The machine is now ready to receive the data. Simply boot up your
Syllable machine with the debugging options enabled and hey presto!</p>

<h3>Windows - Teraterm</h3>

<p>At the startup dialog select Serial and COM1. Then go to the "Setup"
menu and select the "Serial Port..." item. Set the baud rate to 19200
and check that data is set to 8 bit, parity to none and stop bit to 1.
Now go to the "File" menu and select the "Log..." item. Select where
you wish the log to be saved and you are ready to go. Simply boot up
your Syllable machine with the debugging options enabled and hey presto!</p>

<p id="tutorialname">Backing Up Your Installation to CD</p>
<p>To create an iso image of an installation as a backup so that you
can use it to re-install after a fatal disk crash, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li> Write a quick shell script to tar/bzip up the root directory (/).
Then use mkisofs to create a simple ISO with that .tar.bz2 on it as a
single file. OR</li>

<li> Hack up the "mkdist.sh" script which is used to create the
installation CD image. It's in CVS at syllable/system/build-tools/ and
relies on everything else in that directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 1 is quicker, easier, and foolproof.</p>
<p id="tutorialname">Booting from the Install CD</p>
<p>If something goes wrong with your installation and you need to
modify the files on your Syllable installation, from the CD but exit
the installation script. Now mount your Syllable partition from the
Terminal, like so:
</p>
<pre>$ mkdir /syllable
$ mount /dev/disk/ata/hda/0 /syllable
</pre>

<p>Now cd to the directory that needs to be modified.  For example, if one of your network drivers is corrupted, type:

</p>
<pre>$ cd /syllable/atheos/sys/drivers/net/eth/
$ rm &lt;driver&gt;
</pre>

<p>Now reboot and remove the CD from the drive.

</p>
<p></p><p id="tutorialname">Disabling extra CPUs</p>
<p>If you're having trouble booting Syllable on a multiple CPU system,
edit the Grub boot menu and add the following to the Syllable kernel
line:
</p>
<pre>disable_smp=true
</pre>
<p></p> </div>
