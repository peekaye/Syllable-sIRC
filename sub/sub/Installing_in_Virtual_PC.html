<div id="sectiontext">Q: Does Syllable work in Connectix Virtual PC (version 3, 4, or 5)?</div>

<p>Short answer: Not yet.  The install freezes.</p>

<p>In earlier versions of Syllable, A BIOS limitation seems to halt an untar. Everything else functions correctly and as expected.</p>

<p>All versions of VPC have notable differences, particularly between
3.x and the others. VPC 3 seems to have the best support for generic PC
compatability (i.e., not just for Microsoft products). If you want to
get Syllable to boot from GRUB in the MBR, you will probably end up
using version 3 to make a final distributable image.</p>

<p>The normal diskette boot to install works great. Get the diskette images for use with VPC from:</p>

<p><a href="http://agentm.perlmonk.org/projects/SyllableVPC/SyllableBootDiskettes.sit.hqx">http://agentm.perlmonk.org/projects/SyllableVPC/SyllableBootDiskettes.sit.hqx</a></p>

<p>Here are some quick instructions to get to the point of failure yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li> Set up the disks. Make a new "Syllable" configuration and create a
new hard drive image for it using the Disk Assistance ("Windows, Linux,
Other, etc." &#8211; the drive type is irrelevant since it will be
overwritten anyway). At least 500 MB is recommended for a developer's
installation. VPC comes minimally with DOS (or once long ago, Linux),
so you can download the <code>base-syllable...tar.gz</code> file onto
the FAT partition you normally use or you'll have to make one of those,
too. Syllable will be able to access the FAT partition later. In the
Settings, set Drive 1 to the new and empty Syllable disk and Drive 2 to
the FAT drive.</li>
<li> Boot into the Syllable installation shell &#8211; just like the generic
install. You'll need, of course, the disk images that I mention above.
You will not need nor use a real disk drive. You can drag the boot
diskette images onto the disk icon in the toolbar to "insert" it. You
pretty much just drag on diskette 1, restart the virtual machine, drag
on diskette 2 when prompted, dragon on diskette 3 when prompted, then
click <strong>OK</strong>. The shell will fire up in a matter of seconds.</li>
<li> See shells. If you've followed the instructions, <span id="filename">/dev/disk/bios/hda/0</span> is the empty Syllable hard drive and <span id="filename">/dev/disk/bios/hdb/0</span> is the hard drive with the FAT partition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now,</p>

<div id="terminal">
$ <b>format /dev/disk/bios/hda/0 afs Syllable</b><br>
$ <b>mkdir dos</b><br>
$ <b>mkdir afs</b><br>
$ <b>mount /dev/disk/bios/hda/0 afs</b><br>
$ <b>mount /dev/disk/bios/hdb/0 dos</b><br>
$ <b>cd /afs</b><br>
$ <b>tar -zvxpf /dos/base-syllable...tar.gz</b> (use the <strong>Tab</strong> key for auto-completion)<br>
</div>

<p>Now here's the trouble! No matter which version of VPC you'll use,
kernel options you'll try, or memory adjustments you'll make, the tar
write will block on 6 MB of hard drive writes (according to VPC 5's
stats). The untar'ing just blocks forever on <span id="filename">syllable/Documentation/gui/classos_1_1NodeMonitor-members.html</span> (let <a href="mailto:agentm@cmu.edu">agentm@cmu.edu</a>
know if this is not the case for you). The system does not freeze. You
can resize the shell window, move the mouse, etc., yet nothing
progresses beyond this. Obviously, this has something to do with a
limitation in the BIOS hard drive access.</p>

<p>Send mail to the syllable-developer mailing list if you can get
beyond this. Currently, AgentM's efforts involve stripping down the <span id="filename">base-syllable...tar.gz</span> for essential components to get beyond the evil NodeMonitor documentation.</p>

write it so that it accesses things in chunks of less than 6mb's then...
