<p>To create a decorator:

</p>
<ol>
<li> Get the appserver source</li>
<li> Dive into system/sys/appserver/appserver/drivers/decorators</li>
<li> Copy one of the dirs</li>
<li> Hack away! :-)</li>
<p></p></ol>

<p></p>
<p>It's far easier to make a base a new decorator on existing code than
to write from scratch. It's recommended that you try any decorator
other than the Beish decorator, which is messy in places.
</p>
<p>The Win98 and Amiga decorators are fairly easy to play around with.
All of the decorators are built with vanilla drawing functions in C++;
there are no pixmaps involved.
</p>
<p>Essentially, you have a function which looks out for collisions (ie
mouse over corners), a function which return button presses, various
functions to draw the buttons, and a layout function which orders it
all. There's more to it than that &#8211; but they're easy to get started
with.
