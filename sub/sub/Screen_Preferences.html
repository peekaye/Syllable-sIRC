<p>The Screen Preferences window lets you control the resolution,
colour depth, and refresh rate of this workspace or any workspace.
</p>
<p>(Syllable maintains twelve <em>workspaces</em>, which you can think
of as different work areas. If you launch a window in one workspace,
you can switch to another workspace and it will be clear of the window
in the first workspace. Multiple workspaces let you organize windows
into different areas. To switch to workspace 2, press <strong>Alt F2</strong>; to switch to workspace 3, press <strong>Alt F3</strong>, and so forth.)

</p>
<p>NOTE: You must be logged in as root to change screen preferences.

</p>
<p>The <strong>Resolution</strong> controls how many pixels Syllable
will display on the screen. A higher resolution will fit more on the
screen, but everything on the screen will be smaller. Also, some older
video cards and monitors do not support higher resolutions. You can
choose from the following resolutions: 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768,
1152x864, or 1280x1024.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Colour Depth</strong> controls the number of colors
Syllable will use for each pixel. A higher colour depth will give you
richer colors, but might slow down your computer somewhat. You can
choose from the following colour depths: 15 Bit, 16 Bit, or 32 Bit. 16
Bit is generally the best option.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Refresh Rate</strong> controls how many times per second
Syllable refreshes the display. A higher refresh rate is usually easier
on the eyes, but some older video cards and monitors do not support
higher refresh rates. A high refresh rate could permanently damage your
video card! You can choose from the following refresh rates: 60 Hz, 75
Hz, or 100 Hz. Leave it on 60Hz if you've got an LCD.
</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Apply to</strong> drop-down menu to select whether to apply your changes to <em>This workspace</em> or <em>All workspaces</em>.

</p>
<p>When trying a setting for the first time, go to a new workspace (press <strong>ALT F12</strong> for example) and use the <em>This workspace</em>
option. This way, if you choose a setting that corrupts the screen or
locks the computer up, you can recover the system from it. Be careful
of using 32 Bit colour depth with the Matrox driver at this time, as it
may cause lock ups.
</p>
<p>To make changes, change any of the fields, then click the <strong>Apply</strong> button.  To reset all fields to what they were when you first opened the Screen Preferences windnow, click the <strong>Undo</strong> button.  To reset the fields to their default values of resolution <em>640x480</em>, colour depth <em>15 Bit</em>, and refresh rate <em>60 Hz</em>, click the <strong>Default</strong> button.

<hr>We should probably add a confirm-dialogue so Syllable switches back
within 10 seconds (or something like that) if the change isn't
confirmed. That would be immensely useful when you choose a refresh
rate the monitor cannot handle.
