Known Issues/Problems

This is a alpha release - I'm worried that i'm not going to get very much done in the next 2 months due to exams at uni.
Basically sIRC can connect to a single channel (which has to be changed in the source) and can send and receive messages.
All other functionallity needs to be added!!!!!!!!!
