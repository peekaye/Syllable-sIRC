libnet Alpha 1
--------------

This is an Alpha of the libnet highlevel C++ network API for Syllable.  It
includes the library itself (With inline-documentation), headers, a simple
testsuite and a quickly hacked together demo of AView 0.4

libnet Alpha 1 includes only a very limited subset of the final classes and
is intended as a demonstration of the structure and class inheritence of
libnet.  libnet Alpha 1 can only understand two protocols; file:// and http://

file:// streams are handled by the libsyllable os::File class.  http://
streams are handled by an extremly simple, non-RFC compliant Httpstream
class which can be used to retrieve a stream of data from an HTTP server,
but no does not support any HTTP features or errors.

--------------

To build libnet you will require Syllable 0.5.3 and GCC 3.3.  To install
libnet Alpha 1 just run:

$ make install

This will copy the libnet headers to /ainc/libnet, build libnet.so.1 and
install it into /system/libs

You can build the test-suite with:

$ make test

and then:

$ make test-run

The testsuite will attempt to contact various websites, so if you are not on
a network or the websites are unreachable the testsuite applications may appear
to hang while they wait for a response.

You can also build the Doxygen documentation with:

$ make doc-install

This will install the documentation into /atheos/Documentation/net  You can read
it with ABrowse at file:///atheos/Documentation/net/index.html

The AView demo can be built with:

$ make demo

This will create a libnet-enabled version of AView.  Only four lines were changed
to make libnet network-capable.

The AView demo can load an image specified by a URL, either a local file:// URL
or a remote http:// URL  For example:

aview "file://home/root/Documents/Pictures/Snow Trees.jpg"

loads and displays the local file "Snow Trees.jpg" whilst:

aview "http://www.syllable.org:80/modules/My_eGallery/gallery/syllable/MediaPlayer1.png"

retrieves and displays the Media Player screenshot from the Syllable website
directly via. HTTP

Note that the port number must be explictly specified E.g. "http://www.syllable.org:80"
is a valid http connection to www.syllable.org on port 80, while "http://www.syllable.org"
will cause libnet to assume a default of port 0, which will not work.
